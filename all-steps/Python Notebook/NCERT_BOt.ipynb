The downward motion of these droplets was viewed through the telescope, equipped with a micrometer eye piece. By measuring the rate of fall of these droplets, Millikan was able to measure the mass of oil droplets. The air inside the chamber was ionized by passing a beam of  X-rays through it. The electrical charge on these oil droplets was acquired by collisions with gaseous ions. The fall of these charged oil droplets can be retarded, accelerated or made stationary depending upon the charge on the droplets and the polarity and strength of the voltage applied to the plate.

Many different names are given to this model, for example, plum pudding, raisin pudding or watermelon. This model In the later half of the nineteenth century \\ndifferent kinds of rays were discovered, besides those mentioned earlier. Wilhalm Röentgen (1845-1923) in 1895 showed that when electrons strike a material in the cathode ray tubes, produce rays which can\\n\\tcause\\tfluorescence \\tin\\tthe\\tfluorescent \\t\\nmaterials placed outside the cathode ray tubes. Since Röentgen did not know the nature of the radiation, he named them X-rays and the name is still carried on.

These rays are of very short wavelengths (∼0.1 nm) and possess electro-magnetic \\ncharacter (Section 2.3.1).\\nHenri Becqueral (1852-1908) observed \\nthat there are certain elements which emit radiation on their own and named this phenomenon as  radioactivity and the \\nelements known as radioactive elements. This\\n\\tfield\\twas\\tdeveloped \\tby\\tMarie\\tCurie,\\t\\nPiere Curie, Rutherford and Fredrick Soddy. It was observed that three kinds of rays i.e., α, β- and \\nγ-rays are emitted. Rutherford \\nfound that α -rays consists of high energy \\nparticles carrying two units of positive charge and four unit of atomic mass.

As \\nestablished earlier, the charge on the proton is equal but opposite to that of electron. The number of protons present in the nucleus is equal to atomic number (Z ). For example, the \\nnumber of protons in the hydrogen nucleus is 1, in sodium atom it is 11, therefore their atomic numbers are 1 and 11 respectively. In order to keep the electrical neutrality,  the number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protons (atomic number, Z\\n ). For exam\\nple, number of electrons in \\nhydrogen atom and sodium atom are 1 and 11 respectively.\\natomic number (Z ) = number of \\nprotons in              \\nthe nucleus of an atom\\n      =  number of electrons\\n          in a nuetral atom   (2.3)\\nWhile the positive charge of the nucleus \\nis due to protons, the mass \\nof the nucleus,  \\ndue to protons and neutrons. As discussed \\nearlier protons and neutrons present in the nucleus are collectively known as nucleons . The total number of nucleons is termed as \\nmass number (\\na) of the atom. \\nmass number ( a) = number of protons (Z )\\n                         + number of\\n         \\n  neutrons (n)           (2.4)\\n2.2.4 isobars and isotopes\\nThe composition of any atom can be \\nrepresented by using the normal element symbol (X) with super-script on the left hand side as the atomic mass number (A) and subscript (Z ) on the left hand side as the\\n \\natomic number (i.e., A\\nZ X).\\nIsobars are the atoms with same mass \\nnumber but different atomic number for \\nexample, 614C and 714N. On the other hand, \\natoms with identical atomic number but different atomic mass number are known as \\nisotopes. In \\nother words (according to \\nequation 2.4), it is evident that difference between the isotopes is due to the presence of different number of neutrons present in the nucleus. For example, considering of hydrogen atom again, 99.985% of hydrogen atoms contain only one proton. This isotope is called protium (\\n11H). Rest of the percentage of \\nhydrogen atom contains two other isotopes, the one containing 1 proton and 1 neutron is called deuterium (\\n12D, 0.015%) and the \\nother one possessing 1 proton and 2 neutrons is called tritium (\\n13t ). The latter isotope is \\nfound in trace amounts on the earth. Other examples of commonly occuring isotopes are: carbon atoms containing 6, 7 and 8 neutrons besides 6 protons (\\n612\\n613\\n614C, C, C); chlorine \\natoms containing 18 and 20 neutrons besides 17 protons (\\n1735\\n1737Cl,C l).\\nLastly an important point to mention \\nregarding isotopes is that chemical properties \\nof atoms are controlled by the number of electrons, which are determined by the number of protons in the nucleus. Number of neutrons present in the nucleus have very little effect on the chemical properties of an element. Therefore, all the isotopes of a given element show same chemical behaviour.\\nUnit 2.indd   35 9/9/2022   4:28:09 PM\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

The theory can also calculate precisely the planetary orbits and these are in agreement with the experimental measurements.\\nThe similarity between the solar system \\nand nuclear model suggests that electrons should move around the nucleus in well defined\\n\\torbits.\\tFurther,\\tthe\\tcoulomb\\tforce\\t\\n(kq1q2/r2 where q1 and q2 are the charges, r \\nis the distance of separation of the charges and k is the proportionality constant) between electron and the nucleus is mathematically similar to the gravitational force. However, when a body is moving in an orbit, it undergoes acceleration even if it is moving with a constant speed in an orbit because of changing direction. So an electron in the nuclear model describing planet like orbits is under acceleration. According to the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell, charged particles when accelerated should emit electromagnetic radiation (This feature does not exist for planets since they are uncharged). Therefore, an electron in an orbit will emit radiation, the energy carried by radiation \\ncomes from electronic motion. The orbit will thus continue to shrink. Calculations show that it should take an electron only 10\\n–8 s \\nto spiral into the nucleus. But this does not happen. Thus, the Rutherford model  \\ncannot explain the stability of an atom.  \\nIf the motion of an electron is described on the basis of the classical mechanics and electromagnetic theory, you may ask that  \\nsince the motion of electrons in orbits is  \\nleading to the instability of the atom, then  \\nwhy not consider electrons as stationary \\nUnit 2.indd   36 9/9/2022   4:28:09 PM\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

A \\nblack body is also a perfect radiator of \\nradiant energy. Furthermore, a black body is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings. It radiates same amount of energy per unit area as it absorbs from its surrounding in any given time. The amount of light emitted (intensity of radiation) from a black body and its spectral distribution depends only on its temperature. At a given temperature, intensity of radiation emitted increases with the increase of wavelength, reaches a maximum value at a given wavelength and then starts decreasing with further increase of wavelength, as shown in Fig. 2.8. Also, as the temperature increases, maxima of the curve shifts to short wavelength.

At high temperatures, an appreciable proportion of radiation is in the visible region of the spectrum. As the temperature is raised, a higher proportion of short wavelength (blue light) is generated. For example, when an iron rod is heated in a furnace,\\n\\tit\\tfirst\\tturns\\tto\\tdull\\tred\\tand\\tthen\\t\\nprogressively becomes more and \\nmore red \\nas the temperature increases. As this is heated further, the radiation emitted becomes  \\nwhite and then becomes blue as the temperature becomes very high. This means that red radiation is most intense at a particular temperature and the blue radiation is more intense at another temperature. This means intensities of radiations of different wavelengths emitted by hot body depend upon its temperature. By late 1850’s it was known that objects made of different material and kept at different temperatures emit different amount of radiation. Also, when the surface of an object is irradiated with light (electromagnetic radiation), a part of radiant energy\\n\\tis\\tgenerally\\treflected\\tas\\tsuch,\\ta\\tpart\\t\\nis absorbed and a part of it is transmitted. The reason for incomplete absorption is that ordinary objects are as a rule imperfect absorbers of radiation. An ideal body, which emi\\nts and absorbs radiations of all frequencies \\nuniformly, is called a black body and the radiation emitted by such a body is called black body radiation. In practice, no such body exists. Carbon black approximates fairly closely to black body. A good physical  approximation to a black body is a cavity with a tiny hole, which has no other opening.

Their frequency of oscillation is changed by interaction with oscilators of electromagnetic radiation. Planck assumed that radiation could be sub-divided into discrete chunks of energy. He suggested that atoms and molecules could emit or absorb energy only in discrete quantities and not in a continuous manner. He gave the name quantum  to the smallest quantity of energy \\nthat can be emitted or absorbed in the form of electromagnetic radiation.

Hertz performed a very interesting \\nexperiment in which electrons (or electric current) were ejected when certain metals (for example potassium, rubidium, caesium etc.) were exposed to a beam of light as shown  \\nin Fig.\\n 2.9. The phenomenon is called \\nPhotoelectric effect. The results observed \\nin this experiment were: \\n(i) The electrons are ejected from the metal \\nsurface as soon as the beam of light strikes the surface, i.e., there is no time lag between the striking of light beam and the ejection of electrons from the metal surface.\\n(\\nii) The number of electrons ejected is proportional to the intensity or brightness of light. \\n(iii)\\n For each metal, there is a characteristic minimum frequency,\\n ν0 (also known \\nas threshold frequency ) below which \\nphotoelectric effect is not observed. At a frequency ν >ν\\n0, the ejected electrons \\ncome out with certain kinetic energy. The kinetic energies of these electrons increase with the increase of frequency of the light used.\\nAll the above results could not be explained \\non the basis of laws of classical physics. According to latter, the energy content of the beam of light depends upon the brightness of the light. In other words, number of electrons ejected and kinetic energy associated with them should depend on the brightness of light. It has been observed that though the number \\nFig.2.9  Equipment for studying the photoelectric  \\neffect. Light of a particular frequency \\nstrikes a clean metal surface inside a vacuum chamber.

Lastly, a more intense beam of light consists of larger number of photons, consequently the number of electrons ejected is also larger as compared to that in an experiment in which a beam of weaker intensity of light is employed. \\nDual Behaviour of Electromagnetic \\nRadiation\\nThe particle nature of light posed a dilemma for \\nscientists. On the one hand, it could explain the black body radiation and  photoelectric effect satisfactorily but on the other hand, it was not consistent with the known wave behaviour of light which could account for the phenomena of interference and diffraction. The only way to resolve the dilemma was to accept the idea that light possesses both particle and wave-like properties, i.e., light\\n\\thas\\tdual\\tbehaviour. \\tDepending \\ton\\t\\nthe\\texperiment, \\twe\\tfind\\tthat\\tlight\\tbehaves\\t\\neither as a wave or as a stream of particles. \\nWhenever radiation interacts with matter, \\nit \\ndisplays particle like properties in contrast to the wavelike properties (interference and diffraction), which it exhibits when it propagates. This concept was totally alien to the way the scientists thought about matter and radiation and it took them a long time to become convinced of its validity. It turns out, as you shall see later, that some microscopic \\nparticles like electrons also exhibit this wave-particle duality.Shining a beam of light on to a metal \\nsurface can, therefore, be viewed as shooting \\na beam of particles, the photons. When a photon\\n\\tof\\tsufficient\\tenergy\\tstrikes\\tan\\telectron\\t\\nin the atom \\nof the metal, it transfers its energy \\ninstantaneously to the electron during the collision and the electron is ejected without any time lag or delay. Greater the energy possessed by the photon, greater will be transfer of energy to the electron and greater the kinetic energy of the ejected electron. In other words, kinetic energy of the ejected electron is proportional to the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation.

As a \\nresult, the beam of light is deviated or refracted from its original path as it passes from one medium to another. It is observed that when a ray of white light is passed through a prism, the wave with shorter wavelength bends more than the one with a longer wavelength. Since ordinary white light consists of waves with all the wavelengths in the visible range, a ray of white light is spread out into a series of coloured bands called spectrum. The light of red colour which has longest wavelength is deviated the least while the violet light, which has shortest wavelength is deviated the most. The spectrum of white light, that we can see, ranges from violet at 7.50 ×  10\\n14 Hz to \\nred at 4× 1014 Hz. Such a spectrum is called \\ncontinuous spectrum. Continuous because violet merges into blue, blue into green and so on. A similar spectrum is produced when a rainbow forms in the sky. Remember that visible light is just a small portion of the electromagnetic radiation (Fig.2.7). When electromagnetic radiation interacts with matter, atoms and molecules may absorb energy and reach to a higher energy state. With higher energy, these are in an unstable state. For returning to their normal (more stable, lower energy states) energy state, the atoms and molecules emit radiations in various \\nregions of the electromagnetic spectrum.\\nEmission and Absorption Spectra\\nThe spectrum of radiation emitted by a substance that has absorbed energy is called an emission spectrum. Atoms, molecules or \\nions that have absorbed radiation are said to be “excited” . To produce an emission \\nspectrum, energy is supplied to a sample by heating it or irradiating it and the wavelength (or frequency) of the radiation emitted, as the sample gives up the absorbed energy, is recorded.\\nAn absorption spectrum is like the \\nphotographic negative of an emission spectrum. A continuum of radiation is passed \\nthrough a sample which absorbs radiation of certain wavelengths. The missing wavelength which corresponds to the radiation absorbed by the matter, leave dark spaces in the bright continuous spectrum.\\nThe study of emission or absorption \\nspectra is referred to as spectroscopy. The \\nspectrum of the visible light, as discussed above, was continuous as all wavelengths (red to violet) of the visible light are represented in the spectra. The emission spectra of atoms in the gas phase, on the other hand, do not show a continuous spread of wavelength from red to\\n\\tviolet,\\trather\\tthey\\temit\\tlight\\tonly\\tat\\tspecific\\t\\nwavelengths with dark spaces between them. Such spectra \\nare called line spectra or \\natomic spectra because the emitted radiation is\\n\\tidentified \\tby\\tthe\\tappearance \\tof\\tbright\\tlines\\t\\nin the spectra (Fig. 2.10 page 45).\\nline emission spectra are of great \\ninterest in the study of electronic structure. Each element has a unique line emission spectrum. The characteristic lines in atomic spectra can be used in chemical analysis to identify unknown atoms in the same way as\\n\\tfingerprints \\tare\\tused\\tto\\tidentify\\tpeople.\\t\\nThe exact matching of lines of the emission spectrum of the atoms of a known element with the \\nlines from an unknown sample \\nquickly establishes the identity of the latter, German chemist, Robert Bunsen (1811-1899) was\\n\\tone\\tof\\tthe\\tfirst\\tinvestigators \\tto\\tuse\\tline\\t\\nspectra to identify elements.\\nElements like rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs) \\nthallium (Tl), indium (In), gallium (Ga) and scandium (Sc) were discovered when their minerals were analysed by spectroscopic me\\nthods.

The hydrogen spectrum consists of several series of lines named after their discoverers. Balmer showed in 1885 on the basis of experimental observations \\n* The restriction of any property to discrete values is called quantization.\\nUnit 2.indd   44 9/9/2022   4:28:11 PM\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

If the position of \\nthe electron is known with high degree of accuracy (∆x is small), then the velocity of the electron will be uncertain [∆(v\\nx) is large]. On \\nthe other hand, if the velocity of the electron is known precisely (∆(v\\nx ) is small), then the \\nposition of the electron will be uncertain  \\n(∆x will be large). Thus, if we carry out some physical measurements on the electron’s position or velocity, the outcome will always depict a fuzzy or blur picture.\\nThe uncertainty principle can be best \\nunderstood with the help of an example. \\nSuppose you are asked to measure the thickness of a sheet of paper with an unmarked metrestick. Obviously, the results obtained would be extremely inaccurate and meaningless. In order to obtain any accuracy, you should use an instrument graduated in units smaller than the thickness of a sheet of the paper. Analogously, in order to determine the position of an electron, we must use a meterstick calibrated in units of smaller than the dimensions of electron (keep in mind that an electron is considered as a point charge and is therefore, dimensionless). To observe an electron, we can illuminate it with “light” or electromagnetic radiation. The “light” used must have a wavelength smaller than the dimensions of an electron. The high  momentum photons of such light \\nph=/unif06c/unif0e6\\n/unif0e8/unif0e7/unif0f6\\n/unif0f8/unif0f7  \\nwould change the energy of electrons by \\ncollisions. In this process we, no doubt, would be able to calculate the position of the electron, but we would know very little about the velocity of the electron after the collision.\\nSignificance of Uncertainty Principle\\nOne of the important implications of the \\nHeisenberg Uncertainty Principle is that it rules out existence of definite paths or trajectories of electrons and other similar particles. The trajectory of an object is determined by its location and velocity at various moments. If we know where a body is at a particular instant and if we also know its velocity and the forces acting on it at that instant, we can tell where the body would be sometime later. We, therefore, conclude that the position of an object and its velocity fix its trajectory. Since for a sub-atomic object such as an electron, it is not possible simultaneously to determine the position and velocity at any given instant to an arbitrary degree of precision, it is not possible to talk of the trajectory of an electron.\\nthe effect of H\\neisenberg Uncertainty \\nPrinciple is significant only for motion of microscopic objects and is negligible for that of macroscopic objects.

In fact an insight into the structure of the atom was needed which could account for wave-particle duality of matter and be consistent with Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This came with the advent of quantum mechanics.\\n2.6 \\n QUantUm mecHanical moDel of \\natom\\nClassic\\nal mechanics, based on Newton’s \\nlaws of motion, successfully describes the \\nmotion of all macroscopic objects such as a falling stone, orbiting planets etc., which have essentially a particle-like behaviour as shown in the previous section. However it fails when applied to microscopic objects like electrons, atoms, molecules etc. This is mainly because of the fact that classical mechanics ignores the concept of dual behaviour of matter especially for sub-atomic particles and the uncertainty principle. The branch of science that takes into account  this dual behaviour of matter is called quantum mechanics . \\nQuantum mechanics is a theoretical \\nscience that deals with the study of the motions of the microscopic objects that have both observable wave like and particle like properties.\\n\\tIt\\tspecifies\\tthe\\tlaws\\tof\\tmotion\\tthat\\tthese objects\\n obey. When quantum mechanics \\nis applied to macroscopic objects (for which \\nwave\\tlike\\tproperties \\tare\\tinsignificant) \\tthe\\t\\nresults are the same as those \\nfrom the \\nclassical mechanics. \\nQuantum mechanics was developed \\nindependently in 1926 by Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger. Here, however, we shall be discussing the quantum mechanics which is based on the ideas of wave motion. The fundamental equation of quantum mechanics was developed by Schrödinger  and it won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933. This equation which incorporates wave-particle duality of matter as proposed by de Broglie is quite complex and knowledge of higher mathematics  is needed to solve it. You will learn its solutions for different systems in higher classes. \\nFor a system (such as an atom or a \\nmolecule whose energy does not change with \\ntime) the \\nschrödinger equati\\non is written \\nas  where  is a mathematical \\noperator called Hamiltonian. Schrödinger gave a recipe of constructing this operator from the expression for the total energy of the system. The total energy of the system takes into account the kinetic energies of all the sub-atomic particles (electrons, nuclei), attractive potential between the electrons and nuclei and repulsive potential among the electrons and nuclei individually. Solution of \\nthis equation gives E and \\nψ.\\nHydrogen Atom and the Schrödinger Equation\\nWhen Schrödinger equation is solved for \\nhydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy levels the electron can occupy and the corresponding wave function(s) (\\nψ) of \\nthe electron associated with each energy level. These quantized energy states and corresponding wave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers (principal quantum number n, azimuthal quantum number l and \\nmagnetic quantum number m\\nl ) arise as a \\nnatural consequence in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. When an electron \\nis in any energy state, the wave function Erwin Schrödinger, an \\nAustrian physicist received his Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of Vienna in 1910. In 1927 Schrödinger succeeded Max Planck at the  University of Berlin at Planck’s request. In 1933, Schrödinger left Berlin because of his opposition to Hitler and Nazi policies and returned to Austria in 1936. After the invasion of Austria by Germany, Schrödinger was forcibly removed from his professorship. He then moved to Dublin, Ireland where he remained for seventeen years. Schrödinger shared the Nobel Prize for Physics with P.A.M. Dirac in 1933.\\nErwin Schrödinger \\n(1887–1961)\\nUnit 2.indd   53 9/9/2022   4:28:17 PM\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

The wave function is a mathematical function whose value depends upon the coordinates of the electron in the atom and does not carry any physical meaning.

The principal difference lies in the consequence of increased nuclear charge. Because of this  all the orbitals are somewhat contracted. Further, as you shall see later (in subsections 2.6.3 and 2.6.4), unlike orbitals of hydrogen or hydrogen like species, whose energies depend only on the quantum number n, the energies of the orbitals in multi-electron \\natoms depend on quantum numbers n and l.\\nimportant features of the Quantum \\nmechanical model of atom\\nQuantum mechanical model of atom is \\nthe picture of the structure of the atom, \\nwhich emerges from the application of \\nthe Schrödinger equation to atoms. The following are the important features of the \\nquantum-mechanical model of atom:\\n1.\\n The energy of electrons in atoms is\\n \\nquantized (i.e., can only have certain \\nspecific values), for example when electrons are bound to the nucleus in atoms.2. The existence of quantised electronic energy levels is a direct result of the wave like properties of electrons and are \\nallowed solutions of Schrödinger \\nwave equation.\\n3. Both the exact position and exact velocity of an electron in\\n an atom \\ncannot be determined simultaneously (Heisenberg uncertainty principle).

Since many such wave functions are possible for an electron, there are many atomic orbitals in an atom. These “one electron orbital wave functions” or orbitals form the basis of the electronic structure of atoms.

An orbit, as proposed by Bohr, is a circular path around the \\nnucleus in which an electron moves. A precise description of this path of the electron is impossible according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr orbits, therefore, have no real meaning and their existence can never be demonstrated experimentally. An atomic orbital, on the other hand, is a quantum mechanical concept and refers to the one electron wave function \\nψ in an atom. It is \\ncharacterized by three quantum numbers (n, l and ml) and its value depends upon the coordinates \\nof the electron. ψ has, by itself, no physical meaning. It is the square of the wave function i.e., | ψ|2 \\nwhich has a physical meaning. | ψ|2 at any point in an atom gives the value of probability density \\nat that point.

Although the \\nshapes of 2s  and 2p  orbitals are different,\\n \\nan electron has the same energy when it is in the 2s orbital as when it is present in 2p orbital. The orbitals having the same energy are called degenerate.  The 1s orbital in a \\nhydrogen atom, as said earlier, corresponds to the most stable condition and is called the ground state and an electron residing in this orbital is most strongly held by the nucleus. An electron in the 2s, 2p or higher orbitals in a hydrogen atom is in excited state.The energy of an electron in a multi-  \\nelectron atom, unlike that of the hydrogen \\natom, depends not only on its principal quantum number (shell), but also on its azimuthal quantum number (subshell). That is, for a given principal quantum number, s,  \\np, d, f ... all have different energies. Within \\na given principal quantum number, the energy of orbitals increases in the order s<p<d<f. For higher energy levels, these \\ndifferences\\n\\tare\\tsufficiently \\tpronounced \\tand\\t\\nstraggering of orbital\\n energy may result, \\ne.g., 4s <3d and 6s <5d; 4f<6p. The main \\nreason for having different energies of the subshells is the mutual repulsion among the electrons in multi-electron atoms. The only electrical interaction present in hydrogen atom is the attraction between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged \\nnucleus. In multi-electron atoms, besides the presence of attraction between the electron and nucleus, there are repulsion terms between every electron and other electrons present in the atom. Thus the stability of an electron in a multi-electron atom is because total attractive interactions are more than the repulsive interactions. In general, the repulsive interaction of the electrons in the outer shell with the electrons in the inner shell are more important. On the other hand, the attractive interactions of an electron increases with increase of positive charge (Ze) on the nucleus.\\n\\tDue\\tto\\tthe\\tpresence\\tof\\telectrons\\tin\\t\\nthe inner shells, the electron in the outer shell will not experience the full positive charge of the nucleus (\\nZe). The effect will be lowered \\ndue to the partial screening of positive charge on the nucleus by the inner shell electrons. This is known as the shielding of the outer \\nshell electrons from the nucleus  by the inner shell electrons, and the net positive charge experienced by the outer electrons is known as effective nuclear charge (Z\\neff e). \\nDespite\\tthe\\tshielding\\tof\\tthe\\touter\\telectrons\\t\\nfrom the nucleus by the inner shell electrons, the attractive force experienced by the outer shell electrons increases with increase of nuclear charge. In other words, the energy of interaction between, the nucleus and electron Fig. 2.16  Energy level diagrams for the few \\nelectronic shells of (a) hydrogen \\natom \\nand (b) multi-electronic atoms. Note that orbitals for the same value of principal quantum number, have the same energies even for different azimuthal quantum number for hydrogen atom.

For example electrons present in spherical shaped, s orbital shields the outer electrons \\nfrom the nucleus more effectively as compared to electrons present in p  orbital. Similarly \\nelectrons present in p  orbitals shield the outer \\nelectrons from the nucleus more than the electrons present in d  orbitals, even though all  \\nthese orbitals are present in the same shell. Further within a shell, due to spherical shape of s orbital, the s  orbital electron spends more \\ntime close to the nucleus in comparison to p orbital electron which spends more time in the vicinity of nucleus in comparison to d orbital electron. In other words, for a given \\nshell (principal quantum number), the Z\\neff \\nexperienced by the electron decreases with \\nincrease of azimuthal quantum number (l), that is, the s orbital electron will be more tightly bound to the nucleus than p orbital electron which in turn will be better tightly bound than the d orbital electron. The energy of electrons in s orbital will be lower (more negative) than that of p orbital electron \\nwhich will have less energy than that of d orbital electron and so on. Since the extent of shielding from the nucleus is different for electrons in different orbitals, it leads to the splitting of energy levels within the same shell (or same principal quantum number), that is, energy of electron in an orbital, as mentioned earlier, depends upon the values of n and l. Mathematically, the dependence \\nof energies of the orbitals on n and l are quite complicated but one simple rule is that, the lower the value of (n + l) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. \\nif two orbitals have \\nthe same value of (n + l\\n), the orbital with \\nlower value of n  will have the lower energy.  \\nThe Table 2.5 illustrates the (n + l ) rule and \\nFig. 2.16 depicts the energy levels of multi-electrons atoms. It may be noted that different subshells of a particular shell have different energies in case of multi-electrons atoms. However, in hydrogen atom, these have the same energy. Lastly it may be mentioned here that energies of the orbitals in the same \\nsubshell decrease with increase in the atomic number (Z\\neff).

The restriction imposed by Pauli’s exclusion principle on the number of electrons in an orbital helps in calculating the capacity of electrons to be present in any subshell.

Exchange Energy : The stabilizing effect arises whenever two or more electrons with the same spin are present in the degenerate orbitals of a subshell.

They are the smallest parts of an element that \\nchemically \\treact.\\tThe\\tfirst\\tatomic\\ttheory,\\tproposed\\tby\\tJohn\\tDalton\\tin\\t1808,\\tregarded\\tatom\\tas\\t\\nthe ultimate indivisible particle of matter. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, it was \\nproved experimentally that atoms are divisible and consist of three fundamental particles: electrons, protons and \\nneutrons . The discovery of sub-atomic particles led to the proposal \\nof various atomic models to explain the structure of atom.\\nThomson in 1898 proposed that an atom consists of uniform sphere of positive electricity \\nwith electrons embedded into it. This model in which mass of the atom is considered to be evenly spread over the atom was proved wrong by Rutherford’s famous alpha-particle scattering experiment in 1909. Rutherford concluded that atom is made of a tiny positively charged nucleus , at its centre with electrons revolving around it in circular orbits . \\nrutherford model, which resembles the solar \\nsystem, was no doubt an improvement over \\nthomson model but it could not account for the stability of the atom i.e.\\n, why the electron \\ndoes not fall into the nucleus. Further, it was also silent about the electronic structure of atoms i.e., about the distribution and relative energies of electrons around the nucleus. The difficulties\\n\\tof\\tthe\\tRutherford \\tmodel\\twere\\tovercome \\tby\\tNiels\\tBohr\\tin\\t1913\\tin\\this\\tmodel\\tof\\tthe\\t\\nhydrogen atom. Bohr postulated that electron moves around the nucleus in \\ncircular orbits. \\nOnly\\tcertain\\torbits\\tcan\\texist\\tand\\teach\\torbit\\tcorresponds \\tto\\ta\\tspecific\\tenergy.\\tBohr\\tcalculated \\t\\nthe energy of electron in various orbits and for each orbit predicted the distance between the electron and nucleus. \\nbohr model, though offering a satisfactory model for explaining the \\nspectra of the hydrogen atom, could not explain the spectra of multi-electron \\natoms. The \\nreason for this was soon discovered. In Bohr model, an electron is regarded as a charged particle\\n\\tmoving\\tin\\ta\\twell\\tdefined\\tcircular\\torbit\\tabout\\tthe\\tnucleus.\\tThe\\twave\\tcharacter \\tof\\t\\nthe\\telectron\\tis\\tignored\\tin\\tBohr’s\\ttheory.\\tAn\\torbit\\tis\\ta\\tclearly\\tdefined\\tpath\\tand\\tthis\\tpath\\tcan\\t\\ncompletely \\tbe\\tdefined\\tonly\\tif\\tboth\\tthe\\texact\\tposition\\tand\\tthe\\texact\\tvelocity\\tof\\tthe\\telectron\\t\\nat the same time are known. \\nThis is not possible according to the Heisenberg uncertainty \\nprinciple. Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only ignores the dual behaviour of electron but also contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle . \\nErwin Schrödinger, in 1926, proposed an equation called Schrödinger equation to \\ndescribe the electron distributions in space and the allowed energy levels in atoms. This equation incorporates de Broglie’s concept of wave-particle duality and is consistent with \\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle. When Schrödinger equation is solved for the electron in a hydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy states the electron can occupy [and the corresponding wave function(s) (\\nψ) (which in fact are the mathematical functions) of the \\nelectron associated with each energy state]. These quantized energy states and corresponding wave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers ( principal \\nquantum number n, azimuthal quantum number l and magnetic quantum number m\\nl) \\narise as a natural consequence in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. The restrictions on the values of these three quantum numbers also come naturally from this solution. The quantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom successfully predicts all aspects of the hydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the Bohr model.\\nAccording to the quantum mechanical model of the atom, the electron distribution of an \\natom containing a number of electrons is divided into shells. The shells, in turn, are thought \\nto consist of one or more subshells and subshells are assumed to be composed of one or more orbitals, which the electrons occupy. While for hydrogen and hydrogen like systems (such as He\\n+, Li2+ etc.) all the orbitals within a given shell have same energy, the energy of \\nthe orbitals in a multi-electron atom depends upon the values of n and l: The lower the value \\nof (n + l ) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same (n + l ) value, \\nthe orbital with lower value of n has the lower energy. In an atom many such orbitals are \\nUnit 2.indd   68 9/9/2022   4:28:23 PM\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

Towards the end of the nineteenth century, it was \\nproved experimentally that atoms are divisible and consist of three fundamental particles: electrons, protons and \\nneutrons . The discovery of sub-atomic particles led to the proposal \\nof various atomic models to explain the structure of atom.\\nThomson in 1898 proposed that an atom consists of uniform sphere of positive electricity \\nwith electrons embedded into it. This model in which mass of the atom is considered to be evenly spread over the atom was proved wrong by Rutherford’s famous alpha-particle scattering experiment in 1909. Rutherford concluded that atom is made of a tiny positively charged nucleus , at its centre with electrons revolving around it in circular orbits . \\nrutherford model, which resembles the solar \\nsystem, was no doubt an improvement over \\nthomson model but it could not account for the stability of the atom i.e.\\n, why the electron \\ndoes not fall into the nucleus. Further, it was also silent about the electronic structure of atoms i.e., about the distribution and relative energies of electrons around the nucleus. The difficulties\\n\\tof\\tthe\\tRutherford \\tmodel\\twere\\tovercome \\tby\\tNiels\\tBohr\\tin\\t1913\\tin\\this\\tmodel\\tof\\tthe\\t\\nhydrogen atom. Bohr postulated that electron moves around the nucleus in \\ncircular orbits. \\nOnly\\tcertain\\torbits\\tcan\\texist\\tand\\teach\\torbit\\tcorresponds \\tto\\ta\\tspecific\\tenergy.\\tBohr\\tcalculated \\t\\nthe energy of electron in various orbits and for each orbit predicted the distance between the electron and nucleus. \\nbohr model, though offering a satisfactory model for explaining the \\nspectra of the hydrogen atom, could not explain the spectra of multi-electron \\natoms. The \\nreason for this was soon discovered. In Bohr model, an electron is regarded as a charged particle\\n\\tmoving\\tin\\ta\\twell\\tdefined\\tcircular\\torbit\\tabout\\tthe\\tnucleus.\\tThe\\twave\\tcharacter \\tof\\t\\nthe\\telectron\\tis\\tignored\\tin\\tBohr’s\\ttheory.\\tAn\\torbit\\tis\\ta\\tclearly\\tdefined\\tpath\\tand\\tthis\\tpath\\tcan\\t\\ncompletely \\tbe\\tdefined\\tonly\\tif\\tboth\\tthe\\texact\\tposition\\tand\\tthe\\texact\\tvelocity\\tof\\tthe\\telectron\\t\\nat the same time are known. \\nThis is not possible according to the Heisenberg uncertainty \\nprinciple. Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only ignores the dual behaviour of electron but also contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle . \\nErwin Schrödinger, in 1926, proposed an equation called Schrödinger equation to \\ndescribe the electron distributions in space and the allowed energy levels in atoms. This equation incorporates de Broglie’s concept of wave-particle duality and is consistent with \\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle. When Schrödinger equation is solved for the electron in a hydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy states the electron can occupy [and the corresponding wave function(s) (\\nψ) (which in fact are the mathematical functions) of the \\nelectron associated with each energy state]. These quantized energy states and corresponding wave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers ( principal \\nquantum number n, azimuthal quantum number l and magnetic quantum number m\\nl) \\narise as a natural consequence in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. The restrictions on the values of these three quantum numbers also come naturally from this solution. The quantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom successfully predicts all aspects of the hydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the Bohr model.\\nAccording to the quantum mechanical model of the atom, the electron distribution of an \\natom containing a number of electrons is divided into shells. The shells, in turn, are thought \\nto consist of one or more subshells and subshells are assumed to be composed of one or more orbitals, which the electrons occupy. While for hydrogen and hydrogen like systems (such as He\\n+, Li2+ etc.) all the orbitals within a given shell have same energy, the energy of \\nthe orbitals in a multi-electron atom depends upon the values of n and l: The lower the value \\nof (n + l ) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same (n + l ) value, \\nthe orbital with lower value of n has the lower energy. In an atom many such orbitals are \\nUnit 2.indd   68 9/9/2022   4:28:23 PM\\n2024-25\\n')"

For exam\\nple, number of electrons in \\nhydrogen atom and sodium atom are 1 and 11 respectively.\\natomic number (Z ) = number of \\nprotons in              \\nthe nucleus of an atom\\n      =  number of electrons\\n          in a nuetral atom   (2.3)\\nWhile the positive charge of the nucleus \\nis due to protons, the mass \\nof the nucleus,  \\ndue to protons and neutrons. As discussed \\nearlier protons and neutrons present in the nucleus are collectively known as nucleons . The total number of nucleons is termed as \\nmass number (\\na) of the atom. \\nmass number ( a) = number of protons (Z )\\n                         + number of\\n         \\n  neutrons (n)           (2.4)\\n2.2.4 isobars and isotopes\\nThe composition of any atom can be \\nrepresented by using the normal element symbol (X) with super-script on the left hand side as the atomic mass number (A) and subscript (Z ) on the left hand side as the\\n \\natomic number (i.e., A\\nZ X).\\nIsobars are the atoms with same mass \\nnumber but different atomic number for \\nexample, 614C and 714N. On the other hand, \\natoms with identical atomic number but different atomic mass number are known as \\nisotopes. In \\nother words (according to \\nequation 2.4), it is evident that difference between the isotopes is due to the presence of different number of neutrons present in the nucleus. For example, considering of hydrogen atom again, 99.985% of hydrogen atoms contain only one proton. This isotope is called protium (\\n11H). Rest of the percentage of \\nhydrogen atom contains two other isotopes, the one containing 1 proton and 1 neutron is called deuterium (\\n12D, 0.015%) and the \\nother one possessing 1 proton and 2 neutrons is called tritium (\\n13t ). The latter isotope is \\nfound in trace amounts on the earth. Other examples of commonly occuring isotopes are: carbon atoms containing 6, 7 and 8 neutrons besides 6 protons (\\n612\\n613\\n614C, C, C); chlorine \\natoms containing 18 and 20 neutrons besides 17 protons (\\n1735\\n1737Cl,C l).\\nLastly an important point to mention \\nregarding isotopes is that chemical properties \\nof atoms are controlled by the number of electrons, which are determined by the number of protons in the nucleus. Number of neutrons present in the nucleus have very little effect on the chemical properties of an element. Therefore, all the isotopes of a given element show same chemical behaviour.\\nUnit 2.indd   35 9/9/2022   4:28:09 PM\\n2024-25\\n',\n",

It specifies the laws of motion of macroscopic objects.of the massive sun and the electrons being \\nsimilar to the lighter planets. When classical mechanics* is applied to the solar system, it shows\\n\\tthat\\tthe\\tplanets\\tdescribe\\twell-defined \\t\\norbits around t\\nhe sun.

The theory can also calculate precisely the planetary orbits and these are in agreement with the experimental measurements.\\nThe similarity between the solar system \\nand nuclear model suggests that electrons should move around the nucleus in well defined\\n\\torbits.\\tFurther,\\tthe\\tcoulomb\\tforce\\t\\n(kq1q2/r2 where q1 and q2 are the charges, r \\nis the distance of separation of the charges and k is the proportionality constant) between electron and the nucleus is mathematically similar to the gravitational force. However, when a body is moving in an orbit, it undergoes acceleration even if it is moving with a constant speed in an orbit because of changing direction. So an electron in the nuclear model describing planet like orbits is under acceleration. According to the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell, charged particles when accelerated should emit electromagnetic radiation (This feature does not exist for planets since they are uncharged). Therefore, an electron in an orbit will emit radiation, the energy carried by radiation \\ncomes from electronic motion. The orbit will thus continue to shrink. Calculations show that it should take an electron only 10\\n–8 s \\nto spiral into the nucleus. But this does not happen. Thus, the Rutherford model  \\ncannot explain the stability of an atom.  \\nIf the motion of an electron is described on the basis of the classical mechanics and electromagnetic theory, you may ask that  \\nsince the motion of electrons in orbits is  \\nleading to the instability of the atom, then  \\nwhy not consider electrons as stationary \\nUnit 2.indd   36 9/9/2022   4:28:09 PM\\n2024-25\\n',\n",

It radiates same amount of energy per unit area as it absorbs from its surrounding in any given time. The amount of light emitted (intensity of radiation) from a black body and its spectral distribution depends only on its temperature. At a given temperature, intensity of radiation emitted increases with the increase of wavelength, reaches a maximum value at a given wavelength and then starts decreasing with further increase of wavelength, as shown in Fig. 2.8. Also, as the temperature increases, maxima of the curve shifts to short wavelength.

At high temperatures, an appreciable proportion of radiation is in the visible region of the spectrum. As the temperature is raised, a higher proportion of short wavelength (blue light) is generated. For example, when an iron rod is heated in a furnace,\\n\\tit\\tfirst\\tturns\\tto\\tdull\\tred\\tand\\tthen\\t\\nprogressively becomes more and \\nmore red \\nas the temperature increases. As this is heated further, the radiation emitted becomes  \\nwhite and then becomes blue as the temperature becomes very high. This means that red radiation is most intense at a particular temperature and the blue radiation is more intense at another temperature. This means intensities of radiations of different wavelengths emitted by hot body depend upon its temperature. By late 1850’s it was known that objects made of different material and kept at different temperatures emit different amount of radiation. Also, when the surface of an object is irradiated with light (electromagnetic radiation), a part of radiant energy\\n\\tis\\tgenerally\\treflected\\tas\\tsuch,\\ta\\tpart\\t\\nis absorbed and a part of it is transmitted. The reason for incomplete absorption is that ordinary objects are as a rule imperfect absorbers of radiation. An ideal body, which emi\\nts and absorbs radiations of all frequencies \\nuniformly, is called a black body and the radiation emitted by such a body is called black body radiation. In practice, no such body exists. Carbon black approximates fairly closely to black body. A good physical  approximation to a black body is a cavity with a tiny hole, which has no other opening.

The phenomenon is called \\nPhotoelectric effect.

According to latter, the energy content of the beam of light depends upon the brightness of the light. In other words, number of electrons ejected and kinetic energy associated with them should depend on the brightness of light.

For example, red light [ν = (4.3 to 4.6) × 10\\n14 Hz] of any brightness \\n(intensity) may shine on a piece of potassium metal for hours but no photoelectrons are ejected. But, as soon as even a very weak yellow light (ν = 5.1–5.2 × 10\\n14 Hz) shines on \\nthe potassium metal, the photoelectric effect is observed. The threshold frequency (ν\\n0) for \\npotassium metal is 5.0×1014 Hz. \\nEinstein (1905) was able to explain the \\nphotoelectric effect using Planck’s quantum theory of electromagnetic radiation as a starting point. the minimum energy required to eject the \\nelectron is h ν\\n0 (also called work function, \\nW0; Table 2.2), then the difference in energy  \\n(hν – hν0 ) is transferred as the kinetic energy of \\nthe photoelectron. Following the conservation of energy principle, the kinetic energy of the ejected electron is given by the equation 2.7. \\n (2.7)\\nwhere me is the mass of the electron and v  is the \\nvelocity associated with the ejected electron. Lastly, a more intense beam of light consists of larger number of photons, consequently the number of electrons ejected is also larger as compared to that in an experiment in which a beam of weaker intensity of light is employed. \\nDual Behaviour of Electromagnetic \\nRadiation\\nThe particle nature of light posed a dilemma for \\nscientists. On the one hand, it could explain the black body radiation and  photoelectric effect satisfactorily but on the other hand, it was not consistent with the known wave behaviour of light which could account for the phenomena of interference and diffraction. The only way to resolve the dilemma was to accept the idea that light possesses both particle and wave-like properties, i.e., light\\n\\thas\\tdual\\tbehaviour. \\tDepending \\ton\\t\\nthe\\texperiment, \\twe\\tfind\\tthat\\tlight\\tbehaves\\t\\neither as a wave or as a stream of particles. \\nWhenever radiation interacts with matter, \\nit \\ndisplays particle like properties in contrast to the wavelike properties (interference and diffraction), which it exhibits when it propagates. This concept was totally alien to the way the scientists thought about matter and radiation and it took them a long time to become convinced of its validity. It turns out, as you shall see later, that some microscopic \\nparticles like electrons also exhibit this wave-particle duality.Shining a beam of light on to a metal \\nsurface can, therefore, be viewed as shooting \\na beam of particles, the photons. When a photon\\n\\tof\\tsufficient\\tenergy\\tstrikes\\tan\\telectron\\t\\nin the atom \\nof the metal, it transfers its energy \\ninstantaneously to the electron during the collision and the electron is ejected without any time lag or delay. Greater the energy possessed by the photon, greater will be transfer of energy to the electron and greater the kinetic energy of the ejected electron.

As a \\nresult, the beam of light is deviated or refracted from its original path as it passes from one medium to another. It is observed that when a ray of white light is passed through a prism, the wave with shorter wavelength bends more than the one with a longer wavelength. Since ordinary white light consists of waves with all the wavelengths in the visible range, a ray of white light is spread out into a series of coloured bands called spectrum. The light of red colour which has longest wavelength is deviated the least while the violet light, which has shortest wavelength is deviated the most. The spectrum of white light, that we can see, ranges from violet at 7.50 ×  10\\n14 Hz to \\nred at 4× 1014 Hz. Such a spectrum is called \\ncontinuous spectrum. Continuous because violet merges into blue, blue into green and so on. A similar spectrum is produced when a rainbow forms in the sky. Remember that visible light is just a small portion of the electromagnetic radiation (Fig.2.7). When electromagnetic radiation interacts with matter, atoms and molecules may absorb energy and reach to a higher energy state. With higher energy, these are in an unstable state. For returning to their normal (more stable, lower energy states) energy state, the atoms and molecules emit radiations in various \\nregions of the electromagnetic spectrum.\\nEmission and Absorption Spectra\\nThe spectrum of radiation emitted by a substance that has absorbed energy is called an emission spectrum. Atoms, molecules or \\nions that have absorbed radiation are said to be “excited” . To produce an emission \\nspectrum, energy is supplied to a sample by heating it or irradiating it and the wavelength (or frequency) of the radiation emitted, as the sample gives up the absorbed energy, is recorded.\\nAn absorption spectrum is like the \\nphotographic negative of an emission spectrum. A continuum of radiation is passed \\nthrough a sample which absorbs radiation of certain wavelengths. The missing wavelength which corresponds to the radiation absorbed by the matter, leave dark spaces in the bright continuous spectrum.\\nThe study of emission or absorption \\nspectra is referred to as spectroscopy. The \\nspectrum of the visible light, as discussed above, was continuous as all wavelengths (red to violet) of the visible light are represented in the spectra. The emission spectra of atoms in the gas phase, on the other hand, do not show a continuous spread of wavelength from red to\\n\\tviolet,\\trather\\tthey\\temit\\tlight\\tonly\\tat\\tspecific\\t\\nwavelengths with dark spaces between them. Such spectra \\nare called line spectra or \\natomic spectra because the emitted radiation is\\n\\tidentified \\tby\\tthe\\tappearance \\tof\\tbright\\tlines\\t\\nin the spectra (Fig. 2.10 page 45).\\nline emission spectra are of great \\ninterest in the study of electronic structure. Each element has a unique line emission spectrum. The characteristic lines in atomic spectra can be used in chemical analysis to identify unknown atoms in the same way as\\n\\tfingerprints \\tare\\tused\\tto\\tidentify\\tpeople.\\t\\nThe exact matching of lines of the emission spectrum of the atoms of a known element with the \\nlines from an unknown sample \\nquickly establishes the identity of the latter, German chemist, Robert Bunsen (1811-1899) was\\n\\tone\\tof\\tthe\\tfirst\\tinvestigators \\tto\\tuse\\tline\\t\\nspectra to identify elements.\\nElements like rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs) \\nthallium (Tl), indium (In), gallium (Ga) and scandium (Sc) were discovered when their minerals were analysed by spectroscopic me\\nthods. The element helium (He) was \\ndiscovered in the sun by spectroscopic method.\\nLine Spectrum of Hydrogen \\nWhen an electric discharge is passed through \\ngaseous hydrogen, the H2 molecules dissociate \\nand the energetically excited hydrogen atoms produced emit electromagnetic radiation of discrete frequencies. The hydrogen spectrum consists of several series of lines named after their discoverers. Balmer showed in 1885 on the basis of experimental observations \\n* The restriction of any property to discrete values is called quantization.\\nUnit 2.indd   44 9/9/2022   4:28:11 PM\\n2024-25\\n',\n",

If the position of \\nthe electron is known with high degree of accuracy (∆x is small), then the velocity of the electron will be uncertain [∆(v\\nx) is large]. On \\nthe other hand, if the velocity of the electron is known precisely (∆(v\\nx ) is small), then the \\nposition of the electron will be uncertain  \\n(∆x will be large). Thus, if we carry out some physical measurements on the electron’s position or velocity, the outcome will always depict a fuzzy or blur picture.\\nThe uncertainty principle can be best \\nunderstood with the help of an example. \\nSuppose you are asked to measure the thickness of a sheet of paper with an unmarked metrestick. Obviously, the results obtained would be extremely inaccurate and meaningless. In order to obtain any accuracy, you should use an instrument graduated in units smaller than the thickness of a sheet of the paper. Analogously, in order to determine the position of an electron, we must use a meterstick calibrated in units of smaller than the dimensions of electron (keep in mind that an electron is considered as a point charge and is therefore, dimensionless). To observe an electron, we can illuminate it with “light” or electromagnetic radiation. The “light” used must have a wavelength smaller than the dimensions of an electron. The high  momentum photons of such light \\nph=/unif06c/unif0e6\\n/unif0e8/unif0e7/unif0f6\\n/unif0f8/unif0f7  \\nwould change the energy of electrons by \\ncollisions. In this process we, no doubt, would be able to calculate the position of the electron, but we would know very little about the velocity of the electron after the collision.\\nSignificance of Uncertainty Principle\\nOne of the important implications of the \\nHeisenberg Uncertainty Principle is that it rules out existence of definite paths or trajectories of electrons and other similar particles. The trajectory of an object is determined by its location and velocity at various moments. If we know where a body is at a particular instant and if we also know its velocity and the forces acting on it at that instant, we can tell where the body would be sometime later. We, therefore, conclude that the position of an object and its velocity fix its trajectory. Since for a sub-atomic object such as an electron, it is not possible simultaneously to determine the position and velocity at any given instant to an arbitrary degree of precision, it is not possible to talk of the trajectory of an electron.\\nthe effect of H\\neisenberg Uncertainty \\nPrinciple is significant only for motion of microscopic objects and is negligible for that of macroscopic objects. This can be seen from the following examples.\\nIf uncertainty principle is applied to an \\nobject of mass, say about a milligram (10\\n–6 kg), \\nthen \\nWerner Heisenberg (1901  – 1976) Werner Heisenberg (1901  – 1976) received his Ph.D. in \\nphysics from the University of Munich in 1923.

In fact an insight into the structure of the atom was needed which could account for wave-particle duality of matter and be consistent with Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This came with the advent of quantum mechanics.\\n2.6 \\n QUantUm mecHanical moDel of \\natom\\nClassic\\nal mechanics, based on Newton’s \\nlaws of motion, successfully describes the \\nmotion of all macroscopic objects such as a falling stone, orbiting planets etc., which have essentially a particle-like behaviour as shown in the previous section. However it fails when applied to microscopic objects like electrons, atoms, molecules etc. This is mainly because of the fact that classical mechanics ignores the concept of dual behaviour of matter especially for sub-atomic particles and the uncertainty principle. The branch of science that takes into account  this dual behaviour of matter is called quantum mechanics . \\nQuantum mechanics is a theoretical \\nscience that deals with the study of the motions of the microscopic objects that have both observable wave like and particle like properties.\\n\\tIt\\tspecifies\\tthe\\tlaws\\tof\\tmotion\\tthat\\tthese objects\\n obey.

Here, however, we shall be discussing the quantum mechanics which is based on the ideas of wave motion. The fundamental equation of quantum mechanics was developed by Schrödinger  and it won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933. This equation which incorporates wave-particle duality of matter as proposed by de Broglie is quite complex and knowledge of higher mathematics  is needed to solve it. You will learn its solutions for different systems in higher classes. \\nFor a system (such as an atom or a \\nmolecule whose energy does not change with \\ntime) the \\nschrödinger equati\\non is written \\nas  where  is a mathematical \\noperator called Hamiltonian. Schrödinger gave a recipe of constructing this operator from the expression for the total energy of the system. The total energy of the system takes into account the kinetic energies of all the sub-atomic particles (electrons, nuclei), attractive potential between the electrons and nuclei and repulsive potential among the electrons and nuclei individually. Solution of \\nthis equation gives E and \\nψ.\\nHydrogen Atom and the Schrödinger Equation\\nWhen Schrödinger equation is solved for \\nhydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy levels the electron can occupy and the corresponding wave function(s) (\\nψ) of \\nthe electron associated with each energy level. These quantized energy states and corresponding wave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers (principal quantum number n, azimuthal quantum number l and \\nmagnetic quantum number m\\nl ) arise as a \\nnatural consequence in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. When an electron \\nis in any energy state, the wave function Erwin Schrödinger, an \\nAustrian physicist received his Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of Vienna in 1910. In 1927 Schrödinger succeeded Max Planck at the  University of Berlin at Planck’s request. In 1933, Schrödinger left Berlin because of his opposition to Hitler and Nazi policies and returned to Austria in 1936. After the invasion of Austria by Germany, Schrödinger was forcibly removed from his professorship. He then moved to Dublin, Ireland where he remained for seventeen years. Schrödinger shared the Nobel Prize for Physics with P.A.M. Dirac in 1933.\\nErwin Schrödinger \\n(1887–1961)\\nUnit 2.indd   53 9/9/2022   4:28:17 PM\\n2024-25\\n',\n",

Although the \\nshapes of 2s  and 2p  orbitals are different,\\n \\nan electron has the same energy when it is in the 2s orbital as when it is present in 2p orbital. The orbitals having the same energy are called degenerate.  The 1s orbital in a \\nhydrogen atom, as said earlier, corresponds to the most stable condition and is called the ground state and an electron residing in this orbital is most strongly held by the nucleus. An electron in the 2s, 2p or higher orbitals in a hydrogen atom is in excited state.The energy of an electron in a multi-  \\nelectron atom, unlike that of the hydrogen \\natom, depends not only on its principal quantum number (shell), but also on its azimuthal quantum number (subshell). That is, for a given principal quantum number, s,  \\np, d, f ... all have different energies. Within \\na given principal quantum number, the energy of orbitals increases in the order s<p<d<f. For higher energy levels, these \\ndifferences\\n\\tare\\tsufficiently \\tpronounced \\tand\\t\\nstraggering of orbital\\n energy may result, \\ne.g., 4s <3d and 6s <5d; 4f<6p. The main \\nreason for having different energies of the subshells is the mutual repulsion among the electrons in multi-electron atoms. The only electrical interaction present in hydrogen atom is the attraction between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged \\nnucleus. In multi-electron atoms, besides the presence of attraction between the electron and nucleus, there are repulsion terms between every electron and other electrons present in the atom. Thus the stability of an electron in a multi-electron atom is because total attractive interactions are more than the repulsive interactions. In general, the repulsive interaction of the electrons in the outer shell with the electrons in the inner shell are more important. On the other hand, the attractive interactions of an electron increases with increase of positive charge (Ze) on the nucleus.\\n\\tDue\\tto\\tthe\\tpresence\\tof\\telectrons\\tin\\t\\nthe inner shells, the electron in the outer shell will not experience the full positive charge of the nucleus (\\nZe). The effect will be lowered \\ndue to the partial screening of positive charge on the nucleus by the inner shell electrons. This is known as the shielding of the outer \\nshell electrons from the nucleus  by the inner shell electrons, and the net positive charge experienced by the outer electrons is known as effective nuclear charge (Z\\neff e). \\nDespite\\tthe\\tshielding\\tof\\tthe\\touter\\telectrons\\t\\nfrom the nucleus by the inner shell electrons, the attractive force experienced by the outer shell electrons increases with increase of nuclear charge. In other words, the energy of interaction between, the nucleus and electron Fig. 2.16  Energy level diagrams for the few \\nelectronic shells of (a) hydrogen \\natom \\nand (b) multi-electronic atoms. Note that orbitals for the same value of principal quantum number, have the same energies even for different azimuthal quantum number for hydrogen atom. In case of multi-electron atoms, orbitals with same principal quantum number possess different energies for different azimuthal quantum numbers.\\nUnit 2.indd   60 9/9/2022   4:28:20 PM\\n2024-25\\n',\n",

For example electrons present in spherical shaped, s orbital shields the outer electrons \\nfrom the nucleus more effectively as compared to electrons present in p  orbital. Similarly \\nelectrons present in p  orbitals shield the outer \\nelectrons from the nucleus more than the electrons present in d  orbitals, even though all  \\nthese orbitals are present in the same shell. Further within a shell, due to spherical shape of s orbital, the s  orbital electron spends more \\ntime close to the nucleus in comparison to p orbital electron which spends more time in the vicinity of nucleus in comparison to d orbital electron. In other words, for a given \\nshell (principal quantum number), the Z\\neff \\nexperienced by the electron decreases with \\nincrease of azimuthal quantum number (l), that is, the s orbital electron will be more tightly bound to the nucleus than p orbital electron which in turn will be better tightly bound than the d orbital electron. The energy of electrons in s orbital will be lower (more negative) than that of p orbital electron \\nwhich will have less energy than that of d orbital electron and so on. Since the extent of shielding from the nucleus is different for electrons in different orbitals, it leads to the splitting of energy levels within the same shell (or same principal quantum number), that is, energy of electron in an orbital, as mentioned earlier, depends upon the values of n and l. Mathematically, the dependence \\nof energies of the orbitals on n and l are quite complicated but one simple rule is that, the lower the value of (n + l) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. \\nif two orbitals have \\nthe same value of (n + l\\n), the orbital with \\nlower value of n  will have the lower energy.  \\nThe Table 2.5 illustrates the (n + l ) rule and \\nFig. 2.16 depicts the energy levels of multi-electrons atoms. It may be noted that different subshells of a particular shell have different energies in case of multi-electrons atoms. However, in hydrogen atom, these have the same energy. Lastly it may be mentioned here that energies of the orbitals in the same \\nsubshell decrease with increase in the atomic number (Z\\neff).

The restriction imposed by Pauli’s exclusion principle on the number of electrons in an orbital helps in calculating the capacity of electrons to be present in any subshell.

The discovery of sub-atomic particles led to the proposal \\nof various atomic models to explain the structure of atom.\\nThomson in 1898 proposed that an atom consists of uniform sphere of positive electricity \\nwith electrons embedded into it. This model in which mass of the atom is considered to be evenly spread over the atom was proved wrong by Rutherford’s famous alpha-particle scattering experiment in 1909. Rutherford concluded that atom is made of a tiny positively charged nucleus , at its centre with electrons revolving around it in circular orbits . \\nrutherford model, which resembles the solar \\nsystem, was no doubt an improvement over \\nthomson model but it could not account for the stability of the atom i.e.\\n, why the electron \\ndoes not fall into the nucleus.

This equation incorporates de Broglie’s concept of wave-particle duality and is consistent with \\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle. When Schrödinger equation is solved for the electron in a hydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy states the electron can occupy [and the corresponding wave function(s) (\\nψ) (which in fact are the mathematical functions) of the \\nelectron associated with each energy state]. These quantized energy states and corresponding wave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers ( principal \\nquantum number n, azimuthal quantum number l and magnetic quantum number m\\nl) \\narise as a natural consequence in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. The restrictions on the values of these three quantum numbers also come naturally from this solution. The quantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom successfully predicts all aspects of the hydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the Bohr model.\\nAccording to the quantum mechanical model of the atom, the electron distribution of an \\natom containing a number of electrons is divided into shells. The shells, in turn, are thought \\nto consist of one or more subshells and subshells are assumed to be composed of one or more orbitals, which the electrons occupy. While for hydrogen and hydrogen like systems (such as He\\n+, Li2+ etc.) all the orbitals within a given shell have same energy, the energy of \\nthe orbitals in a multi-electron atom depends upon the values of n and l: The lower the value \\nof (n + l ) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same (n + l ) value, \\nthe orbital with lower value of n has the lower energy. In an atom many such orbitals are \\nUnit 2.indd   68 9/9/2022   4:28:23 PM\\n2024-25\\n']"

According to them, the continued subdivisions of matter would ultimately yield atoms which would not be further divisible. The word ‘atom’  has been derived from the Greek word ‘a-tomio’  which \\nmeans ‘uncut-able’ or ‘non-divisible’. These earlier ideas were mere speculations and there was no way to test them experimentally. These ideas remained dormant  for a very long time and were revived again by scientists in the nineteenth century.\\nThe atomic theory of matter was first proposed \\non\\n\\ta\\tfirm\\tscientific \\tbasis\\tby\\tJohn\\tDalton,\\ta\\tBritish\\t\\nschool t\\neacher in 1808. His theory, called Dalton’s \\natomic theory, regarded the atom as the ultimate particle\\n\\tof\\tmatter\\t(Unit\\t1).\\tDalton’s\\tatomic\\ttheory\\twas\\t\\nable to explain the law of conservation of mass, law of constant composition and l\\naw of multiple proportion \\nvery successfully. However, it failed to explain the results of many experiments, for example, it was known that substances like glass or ebonite when rubbed with silk or fur get electrically charged.\\nIn this unit we start with the experimental observations \\nmade by scientists towards the end of nineteenth and beginning of twentieth century.

Before we discuss \\nthese results we need to keep in mind a basic rule regarding the behaviour of charged particles : “Like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other”. \\n2.1.1 Discovery of \\nelectron \\nIn 1830, Michael F\\naraday showed that if \\nelectricity is passed through a solution of an \\nelectrolyte, chemical reactions occurred at the electrodes, which resulted in the liberation and deposition of matter at the electrodes. He formulated certain laws which you will study in Class XII. These results suggested the particulate nature of electricity.\\nIn mid 1850s many scientists mainly \\nFaraday began to study electrical discharge \\nin partially evacuated tubes, known as cathode ray discharge tubes. It is depicted in Fig. 2.1. A cathode ray tube is made of glass containing two thin pieces of metal, called electrodes, sealed in it. The electrical discharge through the gases could be observed only at very low pressures and at very high voltages. The pressure of different gases could be adjusted by evacuation of the glass\\n\\ttubes.\\tWhen\\tsufficiently \\thigh\\tvoltage\\t\\nis applied across the electrodes, current starts\\n\\tflowing\\tthrough\\ta\\tstream\\tof\\tparticles\\t\\nmoving in the tube from the negative electrode (cathode) to \\nthe positive electrode \\n(anode). These were called cathode rays or cathode ray particles.\\n\\tThe\\tflow\\tof\\tcurrent\\t\\nfrom cathode to anode was further checked by making a hole in the anode and coating the tube behind anode with phosphorescent material zinc sulphide. When these \\nrays, \\nafter passing through anode, strike the zinc sulphide coating, a bright spot is developed on the coating [Fig. 2.1(b)].

These particles were discovered by Chadwick (1932) by bombarding a thin sheet of beryllium by α-particles. When electrically neutral \\nparticles having a mass slightly greater than that of protons were emitted. He named these particles as neutrons . The important \\nproperties of all these fundamental particles are given in Table 2.1.\\n2.2\\n atomic moDels\\nObservations obtained from the experiments \\nmentioned in the \\nprevious sections have \\nsuggested \\tthat\\tDalton’s\\tindivisible \\tatom\\tis\\t\\ncomposed of sub-atomic particl\\nes carrying \\npositive and negative charges.

The downward motion of these droplets was viewed through the telescope, equipped with a micrometer eye piece. By measuring the rate of fall of these droplets, Millikan was able to measure the mass of oil droplets. The air inside the chamber was ionized by passing a beam of  X-rays through it. The electrical charge on these oil droplets was acquired by collisions with gaseous ions. The fall of these charged oil droplets can be retarded, accelerated or made stationary depending upon the charge on the droplets and the polarity and strength of the voltage applied to the plate.

The electrons \\nare embedded into it in such a manner as to give the most stable electrostatic arrangement (Fig. 2.4). Many different names are given to this model, for example, plum pudding, raisin pudding or watermelon. This model In the later half of the nineteenth century \\ndifferent kinds of rays were discovered, besides those mentioned earlier. Wilhalm Röentgen (1845-1923) in 1895 showed that when electrons strike a material in the cathode ray tubes, produce rays which can\\n\\tcause\\tfluorescence \\tin\\tthe\\tfluorescent \\t\\nmaterials placed outside the cathode ray tubes. Since Röentgen did not know the nature of the radiation, he named them X-rays and the name is still carried on. It was noticed that X-rays are produced effectively when electrons strike the dense metal anode,\\n \\ncalled\\ttargets.\\tThese\\tare\\tnot\\tdeflected\\tby\\tthe\\t\\nelectric\\tand\\tmagnetic\\tfields\\tand\\thave\\ta\\tvery\\t\\nhigh penetrating power through the matter and that is the reason that these rays \\nare \\nused to study the interior of the objects. These rays are of very short wavelengths (∼0.1 nm) and possess electro-magnetic \\ncharacter (Section 2.3.1).\\nHenri Becqueral (1852-1908) observed \\nthat there are certain elements which emit radiation on their own and named this phenomenon as  radioactivity and the \\nelements known as radioactive elements. This\\n\\tfield\\twas\\tdeveloped \\tby\\tMarie\\tCurie,\\t\\nPiere Curie, Rutherford and Fredrick Soddy. It was observed that three kinds of rays i.e., α, β- and \\nγ-rays are emitted. Rutherford \\nfound that α -rays consists of high energy \\nparticles carrying two units of positive charge and four unit of atomic mass. He concluded that α- particles are helium nuclei as when α - \\nparticles combined with two electrons yielded helium gas. β-rays are negatively charged\\nFig.2.4 Thomson model of atom\\ncan be visualised as a pudding or watermelon \\nof positive charge with plums or seeds (electrons) embedded into it. An important feature of this model is that the mass of the atom is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the atom. Although this model was able to explain the overall neutrality of the atom, but was not consistent with the results of later experiments. Thomson was awarded Nobel Prize for physics in 1906, for his theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases.table 2.1  Properties of fundamental Particles \\nname symbol absolute \\ncharge/ crelative \\nchargemass/kg mass/u approx. \\nmass/u\\nElectron\\nProtonNeutrone\\np\\nn– 1.602176×10\\n–19\\n+ 1.602176×10–19\\n0–1\\n+1\\n09.109382×10–31\\n1.6726216×10–27\\n1.674927×10–270.000541.007271.00867011\\nUnit 2.indd   33 9/9/2022   4:28:08 PM\\n2024-25\\n34\\nchemistry\\nrepresented in Fig. 2.5.

According to this model:\\n(i) The positive charge and most of the mass \\nof the atom was densely concentrated in extremely small region. This very small portion \\nof the atom was called nucleus \\nby Rutherford. \\n(ii)  The nucleus is surrounded by electrons that move around the nucleus with a very high speed in circular paths called orbits.

As \\nestablished earlier, the charge on the proton is equal but opposite to that of electron. The number of protons present in the nucleus is equal to atomic number (Z ). For example, the \\nnumber of protons in the hydrogen nucleus is 1, in sodium atom it is 11, therefore their atomic numbers are 1 and 11 respectively. In order to keep the electrical neutrality,  the number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protons (atomic number, Z\\n ). For exam\\nple, number of electrons in \\nhydrogen atom and sodium atom are 1 and 11 respectively.\\natomic number (Z ) = number of \\nprotons in              \\nthe nucleus of an atom\\n      =  number of electrons\\n          in a nuetral atom   (2.3)\\nWhile the positive charge of the nucleus \\nis due to protons, the mass \\nof the nucleus,  \\ndue to protons and neutrons. As discussed \\nearlier protons and neutrons present in the nucleus are collectively known as nucleons . The total number of nucleons is termed as \\nmass number (\\na) of the atom. \\nmass number ( a) = number of protons (Z )\\n                         + number of\\n         \\n  neutrons (n)           (2.4)\\n2.2.4 isobars and isotopes\\nThe composition of any atom can be \\nrepresented by using the normal element symbol (X) with super-script on the left hand side as the atomic mass number (A) and subscript (Z ) on the left hand side as the\\n \\natomic number (i.e., A\\nZ X).\\nIsobars are the atoms with same mass \\nnumber but different atomic number for \\nexample, 614C and 714N. On the other hand, \\natoms with identical atomic number but different atomic mass number are known as \\nisotopes. In \\nother words (according to \\nequation 2.4), it is evident that difference between the isotopes is due to the presence of different number of neutrons present in the nucleus. For example, considering of hydrogen atom again, 99.985% of hydrogen atoms contain only one proton. This isotope is called protium (\\n11H). Rest of the percentage of \\nhydrogen atom contains two other isotopes, the one containing 1 proton and 1 neutron is called deuterium (\\n12D, 0.015%) and the \\nother one possessing 1 proton and 2 neutrons is called tritium (\\n13t ). The latter isotope is \\nfound in trace amounts on the earth. Other examples of commonly occuring isotopes are: carbon atoms containing 6, 7 and 8 neutrons besides 6 protons (\\n612\\n613\\n614C, C, C); chlorine \\natoms containing 18 and 20 neutrons besides 17 protons (\\n1735\\n1737Cl,C l).\\nLastly an important point to mention \\nregarding isotopes is that chemical properties \\nof atoms are controlled by the number of electrons, which are determined by the number of protons in the nucleus. Number of neutrons present in the nucleus have very little effect on the chemical properties of an element. Therefore, all the isotopes of a given element show same chemical behaviour.\\nUnit 2.indd   35 9/9/2022   4:28:09 PM\\n2024-25\\n36\\nchemistry\\nProblem 2.1 \\nCalculate the number of protons, \\nneutrons and electrons in 80\\n35Br.\\nsolution\\nIn this case, 80\\n35Br, Z = 35, A = 80, species \\nis neutral\\nNumber of protons = number of electrons \\n= Z = 35\\nNumber of neutrons = 80 – 35 = 45, \\n(equation 2.4)\\nProblem 2.2 \\nThe number of electrons, protons and \\nneutrons in a species are equal to 18, 16 and 16 respectively.

Number of neutrons is always given by A–Z, whether the species is neutral or ion.\\n2.2.5 Drawbacks of \\nrutherford model\\nAs you have learnt above, Rutherford nuclear \\nmodel of an atom is like a small scale solar system with the nucleus \\nplaying the role \\n* Classical mechanics is a theoretical science based on Newton’s laws of motion. It specifies the laws of motion of macroscopic objects.of the massive sun and the electrons being \\nsimilar to the lighter planets. When classical mechanics* is applied to the solar system, it shows\\n\\tthat\\tthe\\tplanets\\tdescribe\\twell-defined \\t\\norbits around t\\nhe sun. The gravitational force \\nbetween the planets is given by the expression \\nG.12\\n2mm\\nr/unif0e6\\n/unif0e8/unif0e7/unif0f6\\n/unif0f8/unif0f7 where m1 and m2 are the masses, \\nr is the distance of separation of the masses \\nand G is the gravitational constant. The theory can also calculate precisely the planetary orbits and these are in agreement with the experimental measurements.\\nThe similarity between the solar system \\nand nuclear model suggests that electrons should move around the nucleus in well defined\\n\\torbits.\\tFurther,\\tthe\\tcoulomb\\tforce\\t\\n(kq1q2/r2 where q1 and q2 are the charges, r \\nis the distance of separation of the charges and k is the proportionality constant) between electron and the nucleus is mathematically similar to the gravitational force. However, when a body is moving in an orbit, it undergoes acceleration even if it is moving with a constant speed in an orbit because of changing direction. So an electron in the nuclear model describing planet like orbits is under acceleration. According to the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell, charged particles when accelerated should emit electromagnetic radiation (This feature does not exist for planets since they are uncharged). Therefore, an electron in an orbit will emit radiation, the energy carried by radiation \\ncomes from electronic motion. The orbit will thus continue to shrink. Calculations show that it should take an electron only 10\\n–8 s \\nto spiral into the nucleus. But this does not happen. Thus, the Rutherford model  \\ncannot explain the stability of an atom.  \\nIf the motion of an electron is described on the basis of the classical mechanics and electromagnetic theory, you may ask that  \\nsince the motion of electrons in orbits is  \\nleading to the instability of the atom, then  \\nwhy not consider electrons as stationary \\nUnit 2.indd   36 9/9/2022   4:28:09 PM\\n2024-25\\n37\\nstructure of atom\\naround the nucleus. If the electrons were  \\nstationary, electrostatic attraction between  \\nthe dense nucleus and the electrons would \\npull the electrons toward the nucleus to form a miniature version of Thomson’s model of atom.\\nAnother serious drawback of the \\nRutherford model is that it says nothing about  distribution of the electrons around the nucleus and the energies of these electrons.\\n2.3\\n Develo Pments leaDing to t He \\nboHr’s moDel of atom\\nHistori\\ncally, results observed from the studies \\nof interactions of radiations with matter have \\nprovided immense information regarding the structure of atoms and molecules.

A \\nblack body is also a perfect radiator of \\nradiant energy. Furthermore, a black body is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings. It radiates same amount of energy per unit area as it absorbs from its surrounding in any given time. The amount of light emitted (intensity of radiation) from a black body and its spectral distribution depends only on its temperature. At a given temperature, intensity of radiation emitted increases with the increase of wavelength, reaches a maximum value at a given wavelength and then starts decreasing with further increase of wavelength, as shown in Fig. 2.8. Also, as the temperature increases, maxima of the curve shifts to short wavelength. Several attempts were made to predict the intensity of radiation \\nas a function of wavelength.\\nBut the results of the above experiment \\ncould not be explained satisfactorily on \\nthe basis of the wave theory of light. Max Planck arrived at a satisfactory relationship \\n Fig. 2.8(a)  Black body Fig. 2.8  Wavelength-intensity relationship(iv) Line spectra of atoms with special reference to hydrogen.\\nThese phenomena indicate that the system \\ncan take energy onl\\ny in discrete amounts. \\nAll possible energies cannot be taken up or \\nradiated. \\nIt\\tis\\tnoteworthy \\tthat\\tthe\\tfirst\\tconcrete\\t\\nexplanation for the phenomenon of the black \\nbody radiation mentioned above was given by\\n\\tMax\\tPlanck\\tin\\t1900.\\tLet\\tus\\tfirst\\ttry\\tto\\t\\nunderstand t\\nhis phenomenon, which is  given \\nbelow:\\nHot objects emit electromagnetic \\nradiations over a wide range of wavelengths. At high temperatures, an appreciable proportion of radiation is in the visible region of the spectrum. As the temperature is raised, a higher proportion of short wavelength (blue light) is generated. For example, when an iron rod is heated in a furnace,\\n\\tit\\tfirst\\tturns\\tto\\tdull\\tred\\tand\\tthen\\t\\nprogressively becomes more and \\nmore red \\nas the temperature increases. As this is heated further, the radiation emitted becomes  \\nwhite and then becomes blue as the temperature becomes very high. This means that red radiation is most intense at a particular temperature and the blue radiation is more intense at another temperature. This means intensities of radiations of different wavelengths emitted by hot body depend upon its temperature. By late 1850’s it was known that objects made of different material and kept at different temperatures emit different amount of radiation. Also, when the surface of an object is irradiated with light (electromagnetic radiation), a part of radiant energy\\n\\tis\\tgenerally\\treflected\\tas\\tsuch,\\ta\\tpart\\t\\nis absorbed and a part of it is transmitted. The reason for incomplete absorption is that ordinary objects are as a rule imperfect absorbers of radiation. An ideal body, which emi\\nts and absorbs radiations of all frequencies \\nuniformly, is called a black body and the radiation emitted by such a body is called black body radiation. In practice, no such body exists. Carbon black approximates fairly closely to black body. A good physical  approximation to a black body is a cavity with a tiny hole, which has no other opening.

Their frequency of oscillation is changed by interaction with oscilators of electromagnetic radiation. Planck assumed that radiation could be sub-divided into discrete chunks of energy. He suggested that atoms and molecules could emit or absorb energy only in discrete quantities and not in a continuous manner. He gave the name quantum  to the smallest quantity of energy \\nthat can be emitted or absorbed in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The energy (E) of a quantum of radiation is proportional  \\nto its frequency (ν ) and is expressed by \\nequation (2.6). \\n     E = hυ                                              (2.6)\\nThe proportionality constant, ‘h’ is known \\nas Planck’s constant and has the value  \\n6.626×10\\n–34 J\\ts.\\t\\nWith this theory, Planck was able to explain \\nthe distribution of intensity in the radiation \\nfrom black body as a function of frequency or wavelength at different temperatures. \\nQuantisati\\non has been compared to \\nstanding on a staircase. A person can stand \\non any step of a staircase, but it is not possible for him/her to stand in between the two steps. The energy can take any one of the values from the following set, but cannot take on any \\nvalues between them.\\nE = 0, hυ, 2hυ , 3hυ.... nhυ..... Photoelectric Effect\\nIn 1887, H. Hertz performed a very interesting \\nexperiment in which electrons (or electric current) were ejected when certain metals (for example potassium, rubidium, caesium etc.) were exposed to a beam of light as shown  \\nin Fig.\\n 2.9. The phenomenon is called \\nPhotoelectric effect. The results observed \\nin this experiment were: \\n(i) The electrons are ejected from the metal \\nsurface as soon as the beam of light strikes the surface, i.e., there is no time lag between the striking of light beam and the ejection of electrons from the metal surface.\\n(\\nii) The number of electrons ejected is proportional to the intensity or brightness of light. \\n(iii)\\n For each metal, there is a characteristic minimum frequency,\\n ν0 (also known \\nas threshold frequency ) below which \\nphotoelectric effect is not observed. At a frequency ν >ν\\n0, the ejected electrons \\ncome out with certain kinetic energy. The kinetic energies of these electrons increase with the increase of frequency of the light used.\\nAll the above results could not be explained \\non the basis of laws of classical physics. According to latter, the energy content of the beam of light depends upon the brightness of the light. In other words, number of electrons ejected and kinetic energy associated with them should depend on the brightness of light. It has been observed that though the number \\nFig.2.9  Equipment for studying the photoelectric  \\neffect. Light of a particular frequency \\nstrikes a clean metal surface inside a vacuum chamber. Electrons are ejected from the metal and are counted by a detector that measures their kinetic energy.Max Planck\\n(1858–1947)\\nMax Planck, a German physicist, received his Ph.D in theoretical physics from the University of Munich in 1879. In 1888, he was appointed Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Berlin. \\nPlanck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918 for his quantum theory. Planck also made significant contributions in thermodynamics and other areas of physics.\\nUnit 2.indd   41 9/9/2022   4:28:11 PM\\n2024-25\\n42\\nchemistry\\nof electrons ejected does depend upon the \\nbrightness of light, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons does not. For example, red light [ν = (4.3 to 4.6) × 10\\n14 Hz] of any brightness \\n(intensity) may shine on a piece of potassium metal for hours but no photoelectrons are ejected. But, as soon as even a very weak yellow light (ν = 5.1–5.2 × 10\\n14 Hz) shines on \\nthe potassium metal, the photoelectric effect is observed. The threshold frequency (ν\\n0) for \\npotassium metal is 5.0×1014 Hz. \\nEinstein (1905) was able to explain the \\nphotoelectric effect using Planck’s quantum theory of electromagnetic radiation as a starting point. the minimum energy required to eject the \\nelectron is h ν\\n0 (also called work function, \\nW0; Table 2.2), then the difference in energy  \\n(hν – hν0 ) is transferred as the kinetic energy of \\nthe photoelectron. Following the conservation of energy principle, the kinetic energy of the ejected electron is given by the equation 2.7. \\n (2.7)\\nwhere me is the mass of the electron and v  is the \\nvelocity associated with the ejected electron. Lastly, a more intense beam of light consists of larger number of photons, consequently the number of electrons ejected is also larger as compared to that in an experiment in which a beam of weaker intensity of light is employed. \\nDual Behaviour of Electromagnetic \\nRadiation\\nThe particle nature of light posed a dilemma for \\nscientists. On the one hand, it could explain the black body radiation and  photoelectric effect satisfactorily but on the other hand, it was not consistent with the known wave behaviour of light which could account for the phenomena of interference and diffraction. The only way to resolve the dilemma was to accept the idea that light possesses both particle and wave-like properties, i.e., light\\n\\thas\\tdual\\tbehaviour. \\tDepending \\ton\\t\\nthe\\texperiment, \\twe\\tfind\\tthat\\tlight\\tbehaves\\t\\neither as a wave or as a stream of particles. \\nWhenever radiation interacts with matter, \\nit \\ndisplays particle like properties in contrast to the wavelike properties (interference and diffraction), which it exhibits when it propagates. This concept was totally alien to the way the scientists thought about matter and radiation and it took them a long time to become convinced of its validity. It turns out, as you shall see later, that some microscopic \\nparticles like electrons also exhibit this wave-particle duality.Shining a beam of light on to a metal \\nsurface can, therefore, be viewed as shooting \\na beam of particles, the photons. When a photon\\n\\tof\\tsufficient\\tenergy\\tstrikes\\tan\\telectron\\t\\nin the atom \\nof the metal, it transfers its energy \\ninstantaneously to the electron during the collision and the electron is ejected without any time lag or delay. Greater the energy possessed by the photon, greater will be transfer of energy to the electron and greater the kinetic energy of the ejected electron. In other words, kinetic energy of the ejected electron is proportional to the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation. Since the striking photon has energy equal to hν  and table 2.2  values of Work function (W0) for a few metals \\nmetal Li Na K Mg Cu Ag\\nW0 /ev 2.42 2.3 2.25 3.7 4.8 4.3\\nAlbert Einstein, a German born \\nAmerican physicist, is regarded by many as one of the two great physicists the world has known (the other is Isaac Newton). His three research papers (on special relativity, Brownian motion and the photoelectric effect) which he published in 1905, while he was employed as a technical assistant in a Swiss patent office in Berne have profoundly influenced the development of physics. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.\\nalbert einstein\\n(1879–1955)\\nUnit 2.indd   42 9/9/2022   4:28:11 PM\\n2024-25\\n43\\nstructure of atom\\nProblem 2.6\\nCalculate energy of one mole of photons \\nof radiation whose frequency is 5 ×1014 \\nHz.\\nsolution\\nEnergy (E) of one photon is \\ngiven by the \\nexpression \\nE = hνh = 6.626 ×10\\n–34\\tJ\\ts\\nν = 5×1014 s–1 (given)\\nE = (6.626 ×10–34\\tJ\\ts)\\t×\\t(5\\t×1014 s–1)\\n= 3.313 ×10–19\\tJ\\nEnergy of one mole of photons= (3.313 ×10\\n–19\\tJ)\\t×\\t(6.022\\t×\\t1023 mol–1)\\n=\\t199.51\\tkJ\\tmol–1\\nProblem 2.7A 100 watt bulb emits monochromatic \\nlight of wavelength 400 nm.

As a \\nresult, the beam of light is deviated or refracted from its original path as it passes from one medium to another. It is observed that when a ray of white light is passed through a prism, the wave with shorter wavelength bends more than the one with a longer wavelength. Since ordinary white light consists of waves with all the wavelengths in the visible range, a ray of white light is spread out into a series of coloured bands called spectrum. The light of red colour which has longest wavelength is deviated the least while the violet light, which has shortest wavelength is deviated the most. The spectrum of white light, that we can see, ranges from violet at 7.50 ×  10\\n14 Hz to \\nred at 4× 1014 Hz. Such a spectrum is called \\ncontinuous spectrum. Continuous because violet merges into blue, blue into green and so on. A similar spectrum is produced when a rainbow forms in the sky. Remember that visible light is just a small portion of the electromagnetic radiation (Fig.2.7). When electromagnetic radiation interacts with matter, atoms and molecules may absorb energy and reach to a higher energy state. With higher energy, these are in an unstable state. For returning to their normal (more stable, lower energy states) energy state, the atoms and molecules emit radiations in various \\nregions of the electromagnetic spectrum.\\nEmission and Absorption Spectra\\nThe spectrum of radiation emitted by a substance that has absorbed energy is called an emission spectrum. Atoms, molecules or \\nions that have absorbed radiation are said to be “excited” . To produce an emission \\nspectrum, energy is supplied to a sample by heating it or irradiating it and the wavelength (or frequency) of the radiation emitted, as the sample gives up the absorbed energy, is recorded.\\nAn absorption spectrum is like the \\nphotographic negative of an emission spectrum. A continuum of radiation is passed \\nthrough a sample which absorbs radiation of certain wavelengths. The missing wavelength which corresponds to the radiation absorbed by the matter, leave dark spaces in the bright continuous spectrum.\\nThe study of emission or absorption \\nspectra is referred to as spectroscopy. The \\nspectrum of the visible light, as discussed above, was continuous as all wavelengths (red to violet) of the visible light are represented in the spectra. The emission spectra of atoms in the gas phase, on the other hand, do not show a continuous spread of wavelength from red to\\n\\tviolet,\\trather\\tthey\\temit\\tlight\\tonly\\tat\\tspecific\\t\\nwavelengths with dark spaces between them. Such spectra \\nare called line spectra or \\natomic spectra because the emitted radiation is\\n\\tidentified \\tby\\tthe\\tappearance \\tof\\tbright\\tlines\\t\\nin the spectra (Fig. 2.10 page 45).\\nline emission spectra are of great \\ninterest in the study of electronic structure.

The hydrogen spectrum consists of several series of lines named after their discoverers. Balmer showed in 1885 on the basis of experimental observations \\n* The restriction of any property to discrete values is called quantization.\\nUnit 2.indd   44 9/9/2022   4:28:11 PM\\n2024-25\\n45\\nstructure of atom\\nthat if spectral lines are expressed in terms \\nof wavenumber ( ), then the visible lines of \\nthe hydrogen spectrum obey the following \\nformula:\\n         (2.8)\\nwhere n is an integer equal to or greater than \\n3 (i.e., n = 3,4,5,....)\\nThe series of lines described by this formula \\nare called the balmer series.

That means angular \\nmomentum is quantised. Radiation is emitted or obsorbed only when transition of electron takes place from one quantised value of angular momentum to another.

This means that just as the photon has momentum as well as wavelength, electrons should also have momentum as well as wavelength, de Broglie, from this analogy, gave the following relation between wavelength (λ) and momentum (p) of a material particle.\\nUnit 2.indd   49 9/9/2022   4:28:15 PM\\n2024-25\\n50\\nchemistry\\nsolution\\nAccording to de Brogile equation (2.22)\\n/unif06c/unif03d /unif03d/unif0b4/unif02d\\n/unif02dh\\nmvJs\\nkg ms(. )\\n(. )( )6626 10\\n01 1034\\n1\\n= 6.626 × 10–34 m\\t(J\\t=\\tkg\\tm2 s–2) \\nProblem 2.13\\nThe mass of an electron is 9.1×10–31 kg. \\nIf its K.E. is 3.0× 10–25 J,\\tcalculate \\tits\\t\\nwavelength.\\nsolution\\nSince K.E. = ½ mv2\\nvKE kgms\\nkg==2 23 010\\n91 1012 25 22\\n3112.. .\\n./ /\\nm/unif0e6\\n/unif0e8/unif0e7/unif0f6\\n/unif0f8/unif0f7/unif0b4/unif0b4\\n/unif0b4/unif0e6\\n/unif0e8/unif0e7/unif0f6\\n/unif0f8/unif0f7/unif02d/unif02d\\n/unif02d\\n= 812 m s–1\\nh\\nmvJs 6626 10.34\\nkg ms 91 10 812 (. )( )1 31\\n= 8967 × 10–10 m = 896.7 nm\\nProblem 2.14\\nCalculate the mass of a photon with \\nwavelength 3.6 Å.\\nsolution\\nλ = 3.6 Å = 3.6  × 10–10 m\\nVelocity of photon = velocity of light\\n34\\n10 8 1\\n= 6.135 × 10–29 kg/unif06c/unif03d /unif03dh\\nmh\\npv                                     (2.22)\\nwhere m is the mass of the particle, v its \\nvelocity and p its momentum. de Broglie’s \\nprediction \\twas\\tconfirmed \\texperimentally \\twhen\\t\\nit was f\\nound that an electron beam undergoes \\ndiffraction, a phenomenon characteristic of \\nwaves.

The wavelengths associated with ordinary objects are so short (because of their large masses) that their \\nwave properties cannot \\nbe detected. The wavelengths associated with electrons and other subatomic particles (with very small mass) can however be detected experimentally. Results obtained from the following problems prove these points qualitatively.\\nProblem 2.12\\nWhat will be the wavelength of a ball of \\nmass 0.1 kg moving with a velocity of 10 m s\\n–1 ?2.5.2  Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle \\nWerner Heisenberg a German physicist in \\n1927, stated uncertainty principle \\nwhich is \\nthe consequence of dual behaviour of matter and radiation. \\nit states that it is impossible \\nto determine simultaneously, the exact position and exact momentum (or velocity)  \\nof an electron.\\nMathematically, it can be given as in\\n \\nequation (2.23).Louis de Broglie (1892\\n – 1987) \\nLouis de Broglie, a French \\nphysicist, studied history as an undergraduate in the early \\n1910’s.

He was professor of theoretical physics at the University of Paris from 1932 untill his retirement in 1962. He was awarded the  \\nNobel Prize in Physics in 1929.\\nUnit 2.indd   50 9/9/2022   4:28:16 PM\\n2024-25\\n51\\nstructure of atom\\n                         (2.23)\\nwhere ∆x is the uncertainty in position and \\n∆px (or ∆ vx) is the uncertainty in momentum \\n(or velocity) of the particle. If the position of \\nthe electron is known with high degree of accuracy (∆x is small), then the velocity of the electron will be uncertain [∆(v\\nx) is large]. On \\nthe other hand, if the velocity of the electron is known precisely (∆(v\\nx ) is small), then the \\nposition of the electron will be uncertain  \\n(∆x will be large). Thus, if we carry out some physical measurements on the electron’s position or velocity, the outcome will always depict a fuzzy or blur picture.\\nThe uncertainty principle can be best \\nunderstood with the help of an example. \\nSuppose you are asked to measure the thickness of a sheet of paper with an unmarked metrestick. Obviously, the results obtained would be extremely inaccurate and meaningless. In order to obtain any accuracy, you should use an instrument graduated in units smaller than the thickness of a sheet of the paper. Analogously, in order to determine the position of an electron, we must use a meterstick calibrated in units of smaller than the dimensions of electron (keep in mind that an electron is considered as a point charge and is therefore, dimensionless). To observe an electron, we can illuminate it with “light” or electromagnetic radiation. The “light” used must have a wavelength smaller than the dimensions of an electron. The high  momentum photons of such light \\nph=/unif06c/unif0e6\\n/unif0e8/unif0e7/unif0f6\\n/unif0f8/unif0f7  \\nwould change the energy of electrons by \\ncollisions. In this process we, no doubt, would be able to calculate the position of the electron, but we would know very little about the velocity of the electron after the collision.\\nSignificance of Uncertainty Principle\\nOne of the important implications of the \\nHeisenberg Uncertainty Principle is that it rules out existence of definite paths or trajectories of electrons and other similar particles. The trajectory of an object is determined by its location and velocity at various moments. If we know where a body is at a particular instant and if we also know its velocity and the forces acting on it at that instant, we can tell where the body would be sometime later. We, therefore, conclude that the position of an object and its velocity fix its trajectory. Since for a sub-atomic object such as an electron, it is not possible simultaneously to determine the position and velocity at any given instant to an arbitrary degree of precision, it is not possible to talk of the trajectory of an electron.\\nthe effect of H\\neisenberg Uncertainty \\nPrinciple is significant only for motion of microscopic objects and is negligible for that of macroscopic objects. This can be seen from the following examples.\\nIf uncertainty principle is applied to an \\nobject of mass, say about a milligram (10\\n–6 kg), \\nthen \\nWerner Heisenberg (1901  – 1976) Werner Heisenberg (1901  – 1976) received his Ph.D. in \\nphysics from the University of Munich in 1923. He then spent a year working with Max \\nBorn at Gottingen and three years with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen. He was professor of physics at the University of Leipzig from 1927 to 1941. During World War II, Heisenberg was in charge of German research on the atomic bomb. After the war he was named director of Max Planck Institute for physics in Gottingen. He was also accomplished mountain climber. Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932.\\nUnit 2.indd   51 9/9/2022   4:28:16 PM\\n2024-25\\n52\\nchemistry\\nThe value of ∆v∆x obtained is extremely \\nsmall\\tand\\tis\\tinsignificant. \\tTherefore, \\tone\\t\\nmay say that in dealing with milligram-\\nsized or heavier\\n objects, the associated \\nuncertainties are hardly of any real consequence.\\nIn the case of a microscopic object like an \\nelectron on the other hand. ∆v.∆x obtained is \\nmuch larger and such uncertainties are of real consequence.

As mentioned earlier for large particles, the uncertainty principle sets no meaningful limit to the precision of measurements.\\nReasons for the Failure of the Bohr Model\\nOne can now understand the reasons for the \\nfailure of the Bohr model.

In fact an insight into the structure of the atom was needed which could account for wave-particle duality of matter and be consistent with Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This came with the advent of quantum mechanics.\\n2.6 \\n QUantUm mecHanical moDel of \\natom\\nClassic\\nal mechanics, based on Newton’s \\nlaws of motion, successfully describes the \\nmotion of all macroscopic objects such as a falling stone, orbiting planets etc., which have essentially a particle-like behaviour as shown in the previous section. However it fails when applied to microscopic objects like electrons, atoms, molecules etc. This is mainly because of the fact that classical mechanics ignores the concept of dual behaviour of matter especially for sub-atomic particles and the uncertainty principle. The branch of science that takes into account  this dual behaviour of matter is called quantum mechanics . \\nQuantum mechanics is a theoretical \\nscience that deals with the study of the motions of the microscopic objects that have both observable wave like and particle like properties.\\n\\tIt\\tspecifies\\tthe\\tlaws\\tof\\tmotion\\tthat\\tthese objects\\n obey. When quantum mechanics \\nis applied to macroscopic objects (for which \\nwave\\tlike\\tproperties \\tare\\tinsignificant) \\tthe\\t\\nresults are the same as those \\nfrom the \\nclassical mechanics. \\nQuantum mechanics was developed \\nindependently in 1926 by Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger. Here, however, we shall be discussing the quantum mechanics which is based on the ideas of wave motion. The fundamental equation of quantum mechanics was developed by Schrödinger  and it won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933. This equation which incorporates wave-particle duality of matter as proposed by de Broglie is quite complex and knowledge of higher mathematics  is needed to solve it. You will learn its solutions for different systems in higher classes. \\nFor a system (such as an atom or a \\nmolecule whose energy does not change with \\ntime) the \\nschrödinger equati\\non is written \\nas  where  is a mathematical \\noperator called Hamiltonian. Schrödinger gave a recipe of constructing this operator from the expression for the total energy of the system. The total energy of the system takes into account the kinetic energies of all the sub-atomic particles (electrons, nuclei), attractive potential between the electrons and nuclei and repulsive potential among the electrons and nuclei individually. Solution of \\nthis equation gives E and \\nψ.\\nHydrogen Atom and the Schrödinger Equation\\nWhen Schrödinger equation is solved for \\nhydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy levels the electron can occupy and the corresponding wave function(s) (\\nψ) of \\nthe electron associated with each energy level. These quantized energy states and corresponding wave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers (principal quantum number n, azimuthal quantum number l and \\nmagnetic quantum number m\\nl ) arise as a \\nnatural consequence in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. When an electron \\nis in any energy state, the wave function Erwin Schrödinger, an \\nAustrian physicist received his Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of Vienna in 1910. In 1927 Schrödinger succeeded Max Planck at the  University of Berlin at Planck’s request. In 1933, Schrödinger left Berlin because of his opposition to Hitler and Nazi policies and returned to Austria in 1936. After the invasion of Austria by Germany, Schrödinger was forcibly removed from his professorship. He then moved to Dublin, Ireland where he remained for seventeen years. Schrödinger shared the Nobel Prize for Physics with P.A.M. Dirac in 1933.\\nErwin Schrödinger \\n(1887–1961)\\nUnit 2.indd   53 9/9/2022   4:28:17 PM\\n2024-25\\n54\\nchemistry\\ncorresponding to that energy state contains \\nall information about the electron. The wave function is a mathematical function whose value depends upon the coordinates of the electron in the atom and does not carry any physical meaning. Such wave functions of hydrogen or hydrogen like species with one electron are called atomic orbitals. Such wave functions pertaining to one-electron species are called one-electron systems. The probability\\n\\tof\\tfinding\\tan\\telectron\\tat\\ta\\tpoint\\t\\nwithin an atom is proportional to the \\n|ψ|2 at \\nthat point.  The quantum mechanical results of the hydrogen atom successfully predict all aspects of the hydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the Bohr model.\\nApplication of  Schrödinger equation to \\nmulti-electron\\n\\tatoms\\tpresents\\ta\\tdifficulty: \\tthe\\t\\nSchrödinger equation cannot be solved exactly for\\n\\ta\\tmulti-electron \\tatom.\\tThis\\tdifficulty\\tcan\\t\\nbe overcome by using approximate methods. Such calculat\\nions with the aid of modern \\ncomputers show that orbitals in atoms other than hydrogen do not differ in any radical way from the hydrogen orbitals discussed above. The principal difference lies in the consequence of increased nuclear charge. Because of this  all the orbitals are somewhat contracted. Further, as you shall see later (in subsections 2.6.3 and 2.6.4), unlike orbitals of hydrogen or hydrogen like species, whose energies depend only on the quantum number n, the energies of the orbitals in multi-electron \\natoms depend on quantum numbers n and l.\\nimportant features of the Quantum \\nmechanical model of atom\\nQuantum mechanical model of atom is \\nthe picture of the structure of the atom, \\nwhich emerges from the application of \\nthe Schrödinger equation to atoms. The following are the important features of the \\nquantum-mechanical model of atom:\\n1.\\n The energy of electrons in atoms is\\n \\nquantized (i.e., can only have certain \\nspecific values), for example when electrons are bound to the nucleus in atoms.2. The existence of quantised electronic energy levels is a direct result of the wave like properties of electrons and are \\nallowed solutions of Schrödinger \\nwave equation.\\n3. Both the exact position and exact velocity of an electron in\\n an atom \\ncannot be determined simultaneously (Heisenberg uncertainty principle). The path of an electron in an atom  therefore, can never be determined or known accurately. That is why, as you shall see later on, one talks of only probability of finding\\n\\tthe\\telectron\\tat\\tdifferent\\tpoints\\tin\\t \\nan atom.\\n4. an atomic orbital is the \\nwave \\nfunction ψ for an electron in an atom. \\nWhenever an electron is described by a wave function, we say that the electron occupies that orbital. Since many such wave functions are possible for an electron, there are many atomic orbitals in an atom. These “one electron orbital wave functions” or orbitals form the basis of the electronic structure of atoms. In each orbital, the electron has\\n\\ta\\tdefinite\\tenergy.\\tAn\\torbital\\tcannot\\t\\ncontain more than two electrons.

Qualitatively these orbitals can \\nUnit 2.indd   54 9/9/2022   4:28:17 PM\\n2024-25\\n55\\nstructure of atom\\nbe distinguished by their size, shape and \\norientation. An orbital of smaller size means there\\n\\tis\\tmore\\tchance\\tof\\tfinding\\tthe\\telectron\\t\\nnear the nucleus. Similarly \\nshape and \\norientation mean that there is more probability of\\n\\tfinding\\tthe\\telectron\\talong\\tcertain\\tdirections \\t\\nthan along others. Atomic orbitals are precisely distinguished by what are known as quantum numbers. Each orbital is \\ndesignated by three \\nquantum numbers labelled as n, l and ml. \\nthe principal quantum number ‘n’ is \\na \\npositive integer with value of n = 1,2,3....... The principal quantum number determines \\nthe size and to large extent the energy of the \\norbital.  For hydrogen atom and hydrogen like \\nspecies (He\\n+, Li2+, .... etc.) energy and size of \\nthe orbital depends only on ‘n’.\\nThe principal quantum number also \\nidentifies\\tthe\\tshell. With the increase in the \\nvalue of ‘ n’, the nu\\nmber of allowed orbital \\nincreases and are given by ‘n2’ all the \\norbitals of a given value of ‘n’ constitute \\na single shell of atom and are represented by the following letters\\n      n  =  1   2   3   4   ............ \\nShell =   K  L  M  N ............ \\nSize of an orbital increases with increase of \\nprincipal quantum number ‘n ’. In other words\\n \\nthe electron will be located away from the \\nnucleus. Since energy is required in shifting away the negatively charged electron from the positively charged nucleus, the energy of the orbital will increase with increase of n. \\nazimuthal quantum number. ‘l’ is also \\nknown as \\norbital angular momentum or \\nsubsidiary quantum number. \\tIt\\tdefines\\tthe\\t\\nthree-dimensional shape of the orbital. For a given value of n, l  can have n values ranging \\nfrom \\n0 to n – 1, that is, for a given value of n, \\nthe possible value of l are : l = 0, 1, 2, .......... \\n(n–1)\\nFor example, when n = 1, value of l is only \\n0. For n = 2, the possible value of l can be 0 and 1. For n = 3, the possible l values are 0, \\n1 and 2.\\nEach shell consists of one or more  \\nsub-shells or sub-levels. The number of  sub-shells in a principal shell is equal to the \\nvalue of n.\\n\\tFor\\texample\\tin\\tthe\\tfirst\\tshell\\t(n = 1), \\nthere is only one sub-shell which corresponds to l\\n = 0. There are two sub-shells (l = 0, 1) in \\nthe second shell (n = 2), three (l = 0, 1, 2) in third shell (n  = 3) and so on. Each sub-shell is \\nassigned an azimuthal quantum number (l ). \\nSub-shells corresponding to different values of l are represented by the following symbols.\\nValue for l :\\n 0   1 2   3 4   5 ............\\nnotation for  s   p d   f g   h ............\\nsub-shell \\nTable 2.4 shows the permissible values of \\n‘l ’ for a given principal quantum number and \\nthe corresponding sub-shell notation.\\nmagnetic orbital quantum number.\\n \\n‘ml’ gives information about the spatial \\norientation of the orbital with respect to standard set of co-ordinate axis. For any sub-shell (defined by ‘l’ value) 2 l+1 values of \\nm\\nl are possible and these values are given by :\\nml  = – l, – ( l–1), – ( l–2)... 0,1... ( l–2), ( l–1), l \\nThus for l = 0, the only permitted value \\nof ml = 0, [2(0)+1 = 1, one s orbital]. For l = \\n1, ml can be –1, 0 and +1 [2(1)+1 = 3, three p \\norbitals].

But all these quantum numbers are not enough to explain the line spectr\\na observed in the case of multi-electron \\natoms, that is, some of the lines actually occur in doublets (two lines closely spaced), triplets (three lines, closely spaced) etc. This suggests the presence of a few more energy levels than predicted by the three quantum numbers.\\nIn 1925, George Uhlenbeck and Samuel \\nGoudsmit proposed the presence of the fourth \\nquantum number known as the electron spin quantum number (m\\ns). An electron \\nspins around its own axis, much in a similar way as earth spins around its own axis while revolving around the sun. In other words, an electron has, besides charge and mass, intrinsic spin angular quantum number. Spin angular momentum of the electron — a vector \\nquantity, can have two orientations relative to the chosen axis. These two orientations are distinguished by the spin quantum numbers m\\ns which can take the values of +½ or –½. \\nThese are called the two spin states of the electron and are normally\\n represented by \\ntwo arrows, ↑ (spin up) and ↓ (spin down). Two \\nelectrons that have different ms values (one +½ \\nand the other –½) are said to have opposite \\nspins. An orbital cannot hold more than two electrons and these two electrons should have opposite spins.\\nTo sum up, the four quantum numbers \\nprovide the following information :\\ni)\\n n\\tdefines\\tthe\\tshell,\\t\\tdetermines \\tthe\\tsize\\t\\nof the orbital and also to a large extent the energy of the orbital.\\nii)\\n There are n subshells in the nth shell. l \\nidentifies\\tthe\\tsubshell\\tand\\tdetermines \\t\\nthe shape of the orbital\\n (see section \\n2.6.2). There are (2l+1) orbitals of each type in a subshell, that is, one s orbital (l = 0), three p orbitals (l\\n\\t=\\t1)\\tand\\tfive\\t\\nd orbitals (l \\n= 2) per subshell. To some \\nextent l also determines the energy of \\nthe orbital in a multi-electron atom.\\niii) ml designates the orientation of the \\norbital. For a given value of l , ml has \\n(2l+1) values, the same as the number of orbitals per subshell. It means that \\norbit, orbital and its importance\\nOrbit and orbital are not synonymous. An orbit, as proposed by Bohr, is a circular path around the \\nnucleus in which an electron moves. A precise description of this path of the electron is impossible according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr orbits, therefore, have no real meaning and their existence can never be demonstrated experimentally. An atomic orbital, on the other hand, is a quantum mechanical concept and refers to the one electron wave function \\nψ in an atom. It is \\ncharacterized by three quantum numbers (n, l and ml) and its value depends upon the coordinates \\nof the electron. ψ has, by itself, no physical meaning. It is the square of the wave function i.e., | ψ|2 \\nwhich has a physical meaning. | ψ|2 at any point in an atom gives the value of probability density \\nat that point. Probability density (| ψ|2) is the probability per unit volume and the product of | ψ|2 \\nand\\ta\\tsmall\\tvolume\\t(called\\ta\\tvolume\\telement)\\tyields\\tthe\\tprobability \\tof\\tfinding\\tthe\\telectron\\tin\\tthat\\t\\nvolume (the reason for specifying a small volume \\nelement is that | ψ|2 varies from one region to \\nanother in space but its value can be assumed to be constant within a small volume element).

It is thus possible to get the \\nprobable distribution of an electron in an orbital.\\nUnit 2.indd   56 9/9/2022   4:28:17 PM\\n2024-25\\n57\\nstructure of atom\\nthe number of orbitals is equal to the \\nnumber of ways in which they are oriented. \\niv)\\n ms refers to orientation of the spin of the \\nelectron.\\nAccording to the German physicist, \\nMax Born, the square of the wave function  \\n(i.e.,ψ 2) at a point gives the probability density \\nof the electron at that point. The variation of \\nψ 2 as a function of r for 1s and 2s orbitals \\nis given in Fig. 2.12(b). Here again, you may note that the curves for 1s and 2s orbitals are different.\\nIt may be noted that for 1s  orbital the \\nprobability density is maximum at the nucleus and it decreases sharply as we move away from it. On the other hand, for 2s orbital\\n\\tthe\\tprobability \\tdensity\\tfirst\\tdecreases \\t\\nsharply to zero and again starts increasing. After \\nreaching a small maxima it decreases \\nagain and approaches zero as the value of r increases further. The region where this \\nprobability density function reduces to zero \\nis called nodal surfaces or simply nodes. \\nIn general, it has been found that ns-orbital has (n – 1) nodes, that is, number of nodes increases with increase of principal quantum number n. In other words, number of nodes \\nfor 2s orbital is one, two for 3 s and so on.\\nThese probability density variation can be \\nvisualised in terms of charge cloud diagrams [Fig. 2.13(a)].

It \\nis simply a mathematical function of the coordinates of the electron. However, for different orbitals the plots of corresponding wave functions as a function of r  (the distance \\nfrom the nucleus) are different. Fig. 2.12(a), gives such plots for 1s (n = 1, l = 0) and 2s  \\n(n = 2, l = 0) orbitals. \\nUnit 2.indd   57 9/9/2022   4:28:17 PM\\n2024-25\\n58\\nchemistry\\nof the dots in a region represents electron \\nprobability density in that region.\\nboundary surface diagrams of constant \\nprobability \\ndensity for different orbitals give \\na fairly good representation of the shapes of the orbitals. In this representation, a boundary surface or contour surface is drawn in space for an orbital on which the value of probability density |\\nψ|2 is constant. \\nIn principle many such boundary surfaces may be possible. However, for a given orbital, only that boundary surface diagram of constant probability density* is taken to be good representation of the shape of the orbital which encloses a region or volume in which\\n\\tthe\\tprobability \\tof\\tfinding\\tthe\\telectron\\t\\nis very high, say, 90%. The boundary surface \\ndiagram for 1s \\nand 2s orbitals are given in  \\nFig. 2.13(b). One may ask a question : Why do we not draw a boundary surface diagram, which bounds a region in which the probability of\\n\\tfinding\\tthe\\telectron\\tis,\\t100\\t%?\\tThe\\tanswer\\t\\nto this question is that the probability density |\\nψ|2 has always some value, howsoever \\nsmall\\tit\\tmay\\tbe,\\tat\\tany\\tfinite\\tdistance\\tfrom\\t\\nthe nucleus. It is therefore, not \\npossible to \\ndraw a boundary surface diagram of a rigid size\\n\\tin\\twhich\\tthe\\tprobability \\tof\\tfinding\\tthe\\t\\nelectron is 100%. Boundary surface diagram for a \\ns orbital is actually a sphere centred on \\nthe nucleus. In two dimensions, this sphere looks like a circle. It encloses a region in which\\n\\tprobability \\tof\\tfinding\\tthe\\telectron\\tis\\t\\nabout 90%.\\nThus, we s ee that 1\\ns and 2s orbitals are \\nspherical in shape. In reality all the s-orbitals are spherically symmetric, that is, the probability\\n\\tof\\tfinding\\tthe\\telectron\\tat\\ta\\tgiven\\t\\ndistance is equal in all the directions. It is also observed that the size of the s orbital increases with increase in \\nn, that is, 4s > 3s > 2s > 1s \\nand the electron is located further away from the nucleus as the principal quantum number increases.\\nBoundary surface diagrams for three \\n2p orbitals (l = 1) are shown in Fig. 2.14. In these diagrams, the nucleus is at the origin. Here, unlike s-orbitals, the boundary surface diagrams are not spherical. Instead each  \\np orbital consists of two sections called lobes that are on either side of the plane that passes through the nucleus. The probability density \\n* If probability density |ψ|2 is constant on a given surface, |ψ| is also constant over the surface. The boundary surface \\nfor |ψ|2 and |ψ| are identical.Fig. 2.14  Boundary surface diagrams of the three 2p orbitals.Fig. 2.13  (a) Probability density plots of 1s and \\n2s atomic orbitals.

The size, shape and energy of the three orbitals are identical. They differ however, in the way the lobes are oriented. Since the lobes may be considered to lie along the x, y or z axis, they are given the designations 2p\\nx, 2py, and 2pz. It should be \\nunderstood, however, that there is no simple relation between the values of m\\nl (–1, 0 and +1) \\nand the x, y and z directions. For our purpose, it\\tis\\tsufficient \\tto\\tremember \\tthat,\\tbecause\\t\\nthere are three possible values of ml, there \\nare, therefore, three p  orbitals whose axes \\nare mutually perpendicular. Like s orbitals, p orbitals increase in size and energy with increase in the principal quantum number and hence the order of the energy and size of various p orbitals is 4p  > 3p > 2p. Further, like \\ns orbitals, the probability density functions for p-orbital also pass through value zero, besides \\nat\\n\\tzero\\tand\\tinfinite\\tdistance,\\tas\\tthe\\tdistance\\t\\nfrom the nucleus increases. The number of nodes are given by the n –2, that is number \\nof radial node is 1 for 3p orbital, \\ntwo for 4p \\norbital and so on.\\nFor l = 2, the orbital is known as d-orbital \\nand the minimum value of principal quantum number (n ) has to be 3. as the value of l  cannot \\nbe greater than n–1.\\n\\tThere\\tare\\tfive\\tml values \\n(–2, –1, 0, +1 and +2) for l = 2 and thus there are\\n\\tfive\\td orbitals. The boundary surface \\ndiagram \\nof d orbitals are shown in Fig. 2.15.\\nThe\\tfive\\td-orbitals are designated as dxy, \\ndyz, dxz, dx2–y2 and dz2.\\tThe\\tshapes\\tof\\tthe\\tfirst\\t\\nfour d-orbitals are similar to each other, where \\nas\\tthat\\tof\\tthe\\tfifth\\tone,\\tdz2, is different from \\nothers,\\tbut\\tall\\tfive\\t3d orbitals are equivalent \\nin energy. The d  orbitals for which n  is greater \\nthan 3 \\n(4d, 5d...) also have shapes similar to \\n3d orbital, but differ in energy and size.\\nBesides the radial nodes (i.e., probability \\ndensity function is zero), the probability density functions for the np and nd orbitals are zero at the plane (s), passing through the nucleus (origin). For example, in case of p\\nz \\norbital, xy-plane is a nodal plane, in case of d\\nxy orbital, there are two nodal planes passing \\nthrough the origin and bisecting the xy plane containing z-axis. These are called angular nodes and number of angular nodes are given by ‘l’, i.e., one angular node for p orbitals, two \\nangular nodes for ‘d’ orbitals and so on. \\nthe \\ntotal number of nodes are given by (\\nn–1), \\ni.e., sum of l angular nodes and (n – l – 1) \\nradial nodes.\\n2.6.3 energies of orbitals\\nThe energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom \\nis determi\\nned solely by the principal quantum Fig. 2.15  Boundary surface diagrams of the five \\n3d orbitals.\\nUnit 2.indd   59 9/9/2022   4:28:20 PM\\n2024-25\\n60\\nchemistry\\nnumber. Thus the energy of the orbitals in \\nhydrogen atom  increases as follows :\\n1s < 2s = 2p < 3s = 3p = 3d <4s = 4p = 4d \\n= 4f <                                               (2.23)  \\nand is depicted in Fig. 2.16. Although the \\nshapes of 2s  and 2p  orbitals are different,\\n \\nan electron has the same energy when it is in the 2s orbital as when it is present in 2p orbital. The orbitals having the same energy are called degenerate.  The 1s orbital in a \\nhydrogen atom, as said earlier, corresponds to the most stable condition and is called the ground state and an electron residing in this orbital is most strongly held by the nucleus. An electron in the 2s, 2p or higher orbitals in a hydrogen atom is in excited state.The energy of an electron in a multi-  \\nelectron atom, unlike that of the hydrogen \\natom, depends not only on its principal quantum number (shell), but also on its azimuthal quantum number (subshell). That is, for a given principal quantum number, s,  \\np, d, f ... all have different energies. Within \\na given principal quantum number, the energy of orbitals increases in the order s<p<d<f. For higher energy levels, these \\ndifferences\\n\\tare\\tsufficiently \\tpronounced \\tand\\t\\nstraggering of orbital\\n energy may result, \\ne.g., 4s <3d and 6s <5d; 4f<6p. The main \\nreason for having different energies of the subshells is the mutual repulsion among the electrons in multi-electron atoms. The only electrical interaction present in hydrogen atom is the attraction between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged \\nnucleus. In multi-electron atoms, besides the presence of attraction between the electron and nucleus, there are repulsion terms between every electron and other electrons present in the atom. Thus the stability of an electron in a multi-electron atom is because total attractive interactions are more than the repulsive interactions. In general, the repulsive interaction of the electrons in the outer shell with the electrons in the inner shell are more important. On the other hand, the attractive interactions of an electron increases with increase of positive charge (Ze) on the nucleus.\\n\\tDue\\tto\\tthe\\tpresence\\tof\\telectrons\\tin\\t\\nthe inner shells, the electron in the outer shell will not experience the full positive charge of the nucleus (\\nZe). The effect will be lowered \\ndue to the partial screening of positive charge on the nucleus by the inner shell electrons. This is known as the shielding of the outer \\nshell electrons from the nucleus  by the inner shell electrons, and the net positive charge experienced by the outer electrons is known as effective nuclear charge (Z\\neff e). \\nDespite\\tthe\\tshielding\\tof\\tthe\\touter\\telectrons\\t\\nfrom the nucleus by the inner shell electrons, the attractive force experienced by the outer shell electrons increases with increase of nuclear charge. In other words, the energy of interaction between, the nucleus and electron Fig. 2.16  Energy level diagrams for the few \\nelectronic shells of (a) hydrogen \\natom \\nand (b) multi-electronic atoms. Note that orbitals for the same value of principal quantum number, have the same energies even for different azimuthal quantum number for hydrogen atom. In case of multi-electron atoms, orbitals with same principal quantum number possess different energies for different azimuthal quantum numbers.\\nUnit 2.indd   60 9/9/2022   4:28:20 PM\\n2024-25\\n61\\nstructure of atom\\n(that is orbital energy) decreases (that is  \\nmore negative) with the increase of atomic \\nnumber (Z ).\\nBoth the attractive and repulsive \\ninteractions depend upon the shell and shape \\nof the orbital in which the electron is present. For example electrons present in spherical shaped, s orbital shields the outer electrons \\nfrom the nucleus more effectively as compared to electrons present in p  orbital. Similarly \\nelectrons present in p  orbitals shield the outer \\nelectrons from the nucleus more than the electrons present in d  orbitals, even though all  \\nthese orbitals are present in the same shell. Further within a shell, due to spherical shape of s orbital, the s  orbital electron spends more \\ntime close to the nucleus in comparison to p orbital electron which spends more time in the vicinity of nucleus in comparison to d orbital electron. In other words, for a given \\nshell (principal quantum number), the Z\\neff \\nexperienced by the electron decreases with \\nincrease of azimuthal quantum number (l), that is, the s orbital electron will be more tightly bound to the nucleus than p orbital electron which in turn will be better tightly bound than the d orbital electron. The energy of electrons in s orbital will be lower (more negative) than that of p orbital electron \\nwhich will have less energy than that of d orbital electron and so on. Since the extent of shielding from the nucleus is different for electrons in different orbitals, it leads to the splitting of energy levels within the same shell (or same principal quantum number), that is, energy of electron in an orbital, as mentioned earlier, depends upon the values of n and l. Mathematically, the dependence \\nof energies of the orbitals on n and l are quite complicated but one simple rule is that, the lower the value of (n + l) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. \\nif two orbitals have \\nthe same value of (n + l\\n), the orbital with \\nlower value of n  will have the lower energy.  \\nThe Table 2.5 illustrates the (n + l ) rule and \\nFig. 2.16 depicts the energy levels of multi-electrons atoms. It may be noted that different subshells of a particular shell have different energies in case of multi-electrons atoms. However, in hydrogen atom, these have the same energy. Lastly it may be mentioned here that energies of the orbitals in the same \\nsubshell decrease with increase in the atomic number (Z\\neff). For example, energy of \\n2s orbital of hydrogen atom is greater than that of 2s  orbital of lithium and that of lithium \\nis greater than that of sodium and so on, that \\nis, E\\n2s(H) > E2s(Li) > E2s(Na) > E2s(K).\\n2.6.4 filling of orbitals in atom\\nThe\\tfilling\\tof\\telectrons \\tinto\\tthe\\torbitals\\tof\\t\\ndifferent atoms takes place according to the aufbau principle which is \\nbased on the \\nPauli’s exclusion principle, the Hund’s rule of maximum multiplicity and the relative energies of the orbitals.\\nAufbau Principle\\nThe word ‘aufbau’ in German means ‘building \\nup’.

Thus, there is no single ordering of energies of orbitals which will be universally correct for all atoms.\\nHowever, following order of  energies of \\nthe orbitals is extremely useful:\\n1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s...\\nThe order may be remembered by using \\nthe method given in Fig. 2.17.

According to this principle : no two \\nelectrons in an atom can have the same set of four quan\\ntum numbers. Pauli exclusion \\nprinciple can also be stated as : “ only two \\nelectrons may exist in the same orbital and these electrons must have opposite spin.” This means that \\nthe two electrons can have \\nthe same value of three quantum numbers n, l and m\\nl, but must have the opposite spin \\nquantum number. The restriction imposed by Pauli’s exclusion principle on the number of electrons in an orbital helps in calculating the capacity of electrons to be present in any subshell. For example, subshell 1s  comprises \\none orbital and thus the maximum number of electrons present in 1s  subshell can be two, in \\np and d subshells, the maximum number of electrons can be 6 and 10 and so on.

In the second notation  each orbital of the subshell is represented by a box and the electron is represented by an arrow (↑) a positive spin or an arrow (↓)  a negative spin.

The second \\nelectron in helium (He) can also occupy the 1s\\torbital.\\tIts\\tconfiguration \\tis,\\ttherefore, \\t1s2. \\nAs mentioned above, the two electrons differ from each other with opposite spin, as can be \\nseen from the orbital diagram.\\nThe third electron of lithium (Li) is not \\nallowed in the 1 s orbital because of Pauli \\nexclusion principle. It, therefore, takes the next available choice, namely the 2s orbital.

In potassium (K) and calcium (Ca), the 4s orbital, being lower in energy than the 3d orbitals, is occupied by one and two electrons respectively.\\nA new pattern is followed beginning with \\nscandium (Sc). The 3d  orbital, being lower \\nin energy than the 4p\\n\\torbital,\\tis\\tfilled\\tfirst.\\t\\nConsequently, in the next ten elements, \\nscandium (Sc), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium \\n(Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), \\ncobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn),\\n\\tthe\\tfive\\t3d orbitals are progressively \\noccupied.

Then from lanthanum\\n\\t(La)\\tto\\tmercury\\t(Hg),\\tthe\\tfilling\\tup\\t\\nof electrons takes place in 4\\nf and 5d orbitals.

The modern approach to the chemistry, infact, depends almost entirely on electronic distribution to understand and explain chemical behaviour. For example, questions like why two or more atoms combine to form molecules, why some elements are metals while others are non-metals, why elements like helium and argon are not reactive but elements like the halogens are\\n\\treactive,\\tfind\\tsimple\\texplanation \\tfrom\\tthe\\t\\nelectronic \\tconfiguration. \\tThese\\tquestions \\thave\\t\\nno\\tanswer\\tin\\tthe\\tDaltonian \\tmodel\\tof\\tatom.\\t\\nA detailed understanding of the electronic structure of atom is, therefore, \\nvery essential \\nfor getting an insight into the various aspects of modern chemical knowledge.\\n2.6.6\\n stability of completely filled and  \\n Half filled subshells\\nThe\\tground\\tstate\\telectronic \\tconfiguration \\tof\\t\\nthe atom of an element always corresponds to \\nthe state of the lowest total electronic \\nenergy. \\nThe\\telectronic \\tconfigurations \\tof\\tmost\\tof\\tthe\\t\\natoms follow the basic rules given in Section \\n2.6.5. However, in certain elements such as Cu, or Cr, where the two subshells (4s and 3d) differ slightly in their energies, an electron \\nshifts from a subshell of lower energy (4s ) to a \\nsubshell of higher energy (3d), provided such a shift results in all orbitals of the subshell of higher energy getting either completely filled\\n\\tor\\thalf\\tfilled.\\tThe\\tvalence\\telectronic \\t\\nconfigurations \\tof\\tCr\\tand\\tCu,\\ttherefore, \\tare\\t\\n3d5 4s1 and 3d10 4s1 respectively and not 3d4 \\n4s2 and 3d9 4s2.

Electrons in the same subshell (here 3d) have equal energy but different \\nspatial distribution. \\nConsequently, their shielding of one-another is relatively small and the electrons are more strongly attracted by the nucleus.2. Exchange Energy : The stabilizing effect arises whenever two or more electrons with the same spin are present in the degenerate orbitals of a subshell. These electrons tend to exchange their positions and the energy released due to this exchange is called exchange energy. The number of exchanges that can take place is maximum when the subshell is\\n\\teither\\thalf\\tfilled\\tor\\tcompletely \\tfilled\\t \\n(Fig. 2.18). As a result th\\ne exchange \\nenergy is maximum and so is the stability.\\n You may note that the exchange \\nenergy is at the basis of Hund’s rule that electrons which enter orbitals of equal energy have parallel spins as far as possible. In other words, the extra stability\\n\\tof\\thalf-filled \\tand\\tcompletely \\tfilled\\t\\nsubshell is \\n due to: (i) relatively small \\nshielding, (ii) smaller coulombic repulsion energy, and (iii) larger exchange energy.

Towards the end of the nineteenth century, it was \\nproved experimentally that atoms are divisible and consist of three fundamental particles: electrons, protons and \\nneutrons . The discovery of sub-atomic particles led to the proposal \\nof various atomic models to explain the structure of atom.\\nThomson in 1898 proposed that an atom consists of uniform sphere of positive electricity \\nwith electrons embedded into it. This model in which mass of the atom is considered to be evenly spread over the atom was proved wrong by Rutherford’s famous alpha-particle scattering experiment in 1909. Rutherford concluded that atom is made of a tiny positively charged nucleus , at its centre with electrons revolving around it in circular orbits . \\nrutherford model, which resembles the solar \\nsystem, was no doubt an improvement over \\nthomson model but it could not account for the stability of the atom i.e.\\n, why the electron \\ndoes not fall into the nucleus. Further, it was also silent about the electronic structure of atoms i.e., about the distribution and relative energies of electrons around the nucleus. The difficulties\\n\\tof\\tthe\\tRutherford \\tmodel\\twere\\tovercome \\tby\\tNiels\\tBohr\\tin\\t1913\\tin\\this\\tmodel\\tof\\tthe\\t\\nhydrogen atom. Bohr postulated that electron moves around the nucleus in \\ncircular orbits. \\nOnly\\tcertain\\torbits\\tcan\\texist\\tand\\teach\\torbit\\tcorresponds \\tto\\ta\\tspecific\\tenergy.\\tBohr\\tcalculated \\t\\nthe energy of electron in various orbits and for each orbit predicted the distance between the electron and nucleus. \\nbohr model, though offering a satisfactory model for explaining the \\nspectra of the hydrogen atom, could not explain the spectra of multi-electron \\natoms. The \\nreason for this was soon discovered. In Bohr model, an electron is regarded as a charged particle\\n\\tmoving\\tin\\ta\\twell\\tdefined\\tcircular\\torbit\\tabout\\tthe\\tnucleus.\\tThe\\twave\\tcharacter \\tof\\t\\nthe\\telectron\\tis\\tignored\\tin\\tBohr’s\\ttheory.\\tAn\\torbit\\tis\\ta\\tclearly\\tdefined\\tpath\\tand\\tthis\\tpath\\tcan\\t\\ncompletely \\tbe\\tdefined\\tonly\\tif\\tboth\\tthe\\texact\\tposition\\tand\\tthe\\texact\\tvelocity\\tof\\tthe\\telectron\\t\\nat the same time are known. \\nThis is not possible according to the Heisenberg uncertainty \\nprinciple. Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only ignores the dual behaviour of electron but also contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle . \\nErwin Schrödinger, in 1926, proposed an equation called Schrödinger equation to \\ndescribe the electron distributions in space and the allowed energy levels in atoms. This equation incorporates de Broglie’s concept of wave-particle duality and is consistent with \\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle. When Schrödinger equation is solved for the electron in a hydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy states the electron can occupy [and the corresponding wave function(s) (\\nψ) (which in fact are the mathematical functions) of the \\nelectron associated with each energy state]. These quantized energy states and corresponding wave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers ( principal \\nquantum number n, azimuthal quantum number l and magnetic quantum number m\\nl) \\narise as a natural consequence in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. The restrictions on the values of these three quantum numbers also come naturally from this solution. The quantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom successfully predicts all aspects of the hydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the Bohr model.\\nAccording to the quantum mechanical model of the atom, the electron distribution of an \\natom containing a number of electrons is divided into shells. The shells, in turn, are thought \\nto consist of one or more subshells and subshells are assumed to be composed of one or more orbitals, which the electrons occupy. While for hydrogen and hydrogen like systems (such as He\\n+, Li2+ etc.) all the orbitals within a given shell have same energy, the energy of \\nthe orbitals in a multi-electron atom depends upon the values of n and l: The lower the value \\nof (n + l ) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same (n + l ) value, \\nthe orbital with lower value of n has the lower energy. In an atom many such orbitals are \\nUnit 2.indd   68 9/9/2022   4:28:23 PM\\n2024-25\\n'"

When only electric  field is applied, the electrons deviate  from their path and hit the cathode ray tube at point A (Fig. 2.2). Similarly when only magnetic  field is applied, electron strikes  the cathode ray tube at point C. By carefully balancing  the electrical and magnetic field  strength, it is possible to bring back the electron to the path which is followed in the absence  of electric or magnetic field and they  hit the screen at point B. Thomson argued that the amount of deviation of the particles from  their path in the presence of electrical  or magnetic field depends upon: (i) the magnitude of the negative charge on  the particle, greater the magnitude of the charge on the particle, greater is the interaction with  the electric or magnetic  field and thus greater is the deflection. (ii) the mass of the particle — lighter the  particle, greater the deflection.(iii) the str ength of the electrical or magnetic  field — the deflection  of electrons from its  original path increases with the increase  in the voltage across the electrodes, or the  strength of the magnetic field. By carrying out accurate measurements  on the amount of deflections  observed by  the electrons on the electric field strength or  magnetic field strength, Thomson  was able to  determine the value of  e/me as:  = 1.758820 × 1011 C kg–1                  (2.1) Where me is the mass of the electron in kg  and e is the magnitude of the charge on the  electron in coulomb (C).

These particles were discovered by Chadwick (1932) by bombarding a thin sheet of beryllium by α-particles. When electrically neutral  particles having a mass slightly greater than that of protons were emitted. He named these particles as neutrons . The important  properties of all these fundamental particles are given in Table 2.1. 2.2  atomic moDels Observations obtained from the experiments  mentioned in the  previous sections have  suggested  that Dalton’s indivisible  atom is  composed of sub-atomic particl es carrying  positive and negative charges. The major  problems before the scientists after the discovery of sub-atomic particles were:   to account for the stability of atom,   to compare the behaviour of elements  in terms of both physical and chemical properties,millikan’s oil Drop method In this method, oil droplets in the form of  mist, produced by the atomiser, were allowed to enter through a tiny hole in the upper plate of electrical condenser. The downward motion of these droplets was viewed through the telescope, equipped with a micrometer eye piece. By measuring the rate of fall of these droplets, Millikan was able to measure the mass of oil droplets. The air inside the chamber was ionized by passing a beam of  X-rays through it. The electrical charge on these oil droplets was acquired by collisions with gaseous ions. The fall of these charged oil droplets can be retarded, accelerated or made stationary depending upon the charge on the droplets and the polarity and strength of the voltage applied to the plate. By carefully measuring the effects of electrical field  strength on the motion of oil droplets,  Millikan concluded that the magnitude of electrical charge, q, on  the droplets is always  an integral multiple of the electrical charge, e, that is, q = n e, where n = 1, 2, 3... .   to explain the formation of different  kinds of molecules by the combination of different atoms and,',\n",

Unit 2.indd   32 9/9/2022   4:28:08 PM 2024-25 33 structure of atom Different atomic models were proposed   to explain the distributions of these charged  particles in an atom. Although some of these models were not able to explain the stability of atoms,  two of these models, one proposed  by J.J. Thomson  and the other proposed by  Ernest Rutherford are discussed below. 2.2.1 thomson model of atom J. J. Thomson,  in 1898, proposed that an  atom possesses a  spherical shape (radius  approximately 10–10 m) in which the positive  charge is uniformly distributed. The electrons  are embedded into it in such a manner as to give the most stable electrostatic arrangement (Fig. 2.4). Many different names are given to this model, for example, plum pudding, raisin pudding or watermelon. This model In the later half of the nineteenth century  different kinds of rays were discovered, besides those mentioned earlier. Wilhalm Röentgen (1845-1923) in 1895 showed that when electrons strike a material in the cathode ray tubes, produce rays which can  cause fluorescence  in the fluorescent   materials placed outside the cathode ray tubes. Since Röentgen did not know the nature of the radiation, he named them X-rays and the name is still carried on. It was noticed that X-rays are produced effectively when electrons strike the dense metal anode,   called targets. These are not deflected by the  electric and magnetic fields and have a very  high penetrating power through the matter and that is the reason that these rays  are',\n",
              " 'are  used to study the interior of the objects. These rays are of very short wavelengths (∼0.1 nm) and possess electro-magnetic  character (Section 2.3.1). Henri Becqueral (1852-1908) observed  that there are certain elements which emit radiation on their own and named this phenomenon as  radioactivity and the  elements known as radioactive elements. This  field was developed  by Marie Curie,  Piere Curie, Rutherford and Fredrick Soddy. It was observed that three kinds of rays i.e., α, β- and  γ-rays are emitted. Rutherford  found that α -rays consists of high energy  particles carrying two units of positive charge and four unit of atomic mass. He concluded that α- particles are helium nuclei as when α -  particles combined with two electrons yielded helium gas. β-rays are negatively charged Fig.2.4 Thomson model of atom can be visualised as a pudding or watermelon  of positive charge with plums or seeds (electrons) embedded into it. An important feature of this model is that the mass of the atom is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the atom. Although this model was able to explain the overall neutrality of the atom, but was not consistent with the results of later experiments. Thomson was awarded Nobel Prize for physics in 1906, for his theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases.table 2.1  Properties of fundamental Particles  name symbol absolute  charge/ crelative  chargemass/kg mass/u approx.  mass/u Electron ProtonNeutrone p n– 1.602176×10 –19 + 1.602176×10–19 0–1 +1 09.109382×10–31 1.6726216×10–27 1.674927×10–270.000541.007271.00867011 Unit 2.indd   33 9/9/2022   4:28:08 PM 2024-25 34 chemistry represented in Fig. 2.5.

Whenever α–particles struck the screen, a  tiny flash of light was produced  at that point. The results of scattering experiment were  quite unexpected. According  to Thomson  model of atom, the mass of each gold atom  in the foil should have been spread evenly over the entire atom, and α –particles had  enough energy to pass directly through such a uniform distribution of mass. It was expected that the particles would slow down and change directions only by a small angles as they passed through the foil. It was observed that: (i)  most of the α–particles passed through the  gold foil undeflected. (ii) a small fraction of the α–particles was deflected  by small angles. (iii) a very few α –particles (∼ 1 in 20,000)  bounced back, that is, were deflected by  nearly 180°.  On the basis of the observations,  Rutherford drew the following conclusions regarding the structure of atom: (i)  Most of the space in  the atom is empty as  most of the α–particles passed through  the foil undeflected. (ii) A few posit ively charged α–particles were  deflected.  The deflection  must be due  to enormous repulsive force showing that the positive charge of the atom is not spread  throughout the atom as  Thomson had presumed. The positive charge has to be concentrated in a very small  volume that repelled and deflected  the positively charged α–particles.  (iii) Calculations by Rutherford showed that the vol ume occupied by the nucleus  is negligibly small as compared to the total volume of the atom. The radius of the atom is about 10 –10 m, while that of  nucleus is 10–15 m. One can appreciate',\n",

Schematic molecular view of the gold foil2.2.2  rutherford’s nuclear model of atom Rutherford and his students (Hans Geiger   and Ernest Marsden) bombarded very thin gold foil with α –particles. Rutherford’s famous   –particle scattering experiment is particles similar to electrons. The γ-rays  are high energy radiations like X-rays, are  neutral in nature and do not consist of particles. As regards penetrating power, α-particles are the least, followed by β-rays (100 times that of α–particles) and γ-rays  (1000 times of that α-particles).

On the basis of above observations and  conclusions, Rutherford proposed the nuclear  model of atom. According to this model: (i) The positive charge and most of the mass  of the atom was densely concentrated in extremely small region. This very small portion  of the atom was called nucleus  by Rutherford.  (ii)  The nucleus is surrounded by electrons that move around the nucleus with a very high speed in circular paths called orbits. Thus,  Rutherford’s model of atom  resembles the solar system in which the nucleus plays the role of sun and the electrons that of revolving planets. (iii)   Electrons and the nucleu s are held  together by electrostatic forces of  attraction. 2.2.3  atomic number and mass number The pres ence of positive charge on the nucleus  is due to the protons in the nucleus. As',\n",
              " 'established earlier, the charge on the proton is equal but opposite to that of electron. The number of protons present in the nucleus is equal to atomic number (Z ). For example, the  number of protons in the hydrogen nucleus is 1, in sodium atom it is 11, therefore their atomic numbers are 1 and 11 respectively. In order to keep the electrical neutrality,  the number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protons (atomic number, Z  ). For exam ple, number of electrons in  hydrogen atom and sodium atom are 1 and 11 respectively. atomic number (Z ) = number of  protons in               the nucleus of an atom       =  number of electrons           in a nuetral atom   (2.3) While the positive charge of the nucleus  is due to protons, the mass  of the nucleus,   due to protons and neutrons. As discussed  earlier protons and neutrons present in the nucleus are collectively known as nucleons . The total number of nucleons is termed as  mass number ( a) of the atom.  mass number ( a) = number of protons (Z )                          + number of             neutrons (n)           (2.4) 2.2.4 isobars and isotopes The composition of any atom can be  represented by using the normal element symbol (X) with super-script on the left hand side as the atomic mass number (A) and subscript (Z ) on the left hand side as the   atomic number (i.e., A Z X). Isobars are the atoms with same mass  number but different atomic number for  example, 614C and 714N. On the other hand,  atoms with identical atomic number but different atomic mass number are known as  isotopes. In  other words (according to',\n",
              " 'other words (according to  equation 2.4), it is evident that difference between the isotopes is due to the presence of different number of neutrons present in the nucleus. For example, considering of hydrogen atom again, 99.985% of hydrogen atoms contain only one proton. This isotope is called protium ( 11H). Rest of the percentage of  hydrogen atom contains two other isotopes, the one containing 1 proton and 1 neutron is called deuterium ( 12D, 0.015%) and the  other one possessing 1 proton and 2 neutrons is called tritium ( 13t ). The latter isotope is  found in trace amounts on the earth. Other examples of commonly occuring isotopes are: carbon atoms containing 6, 7 and 8 neutrons besides 6 protons ( 612 613 614C, C, C); chlorine  atoms containing 18 and 20 neutrons besides 17 protons ( 1735 1737Cl,C l). Lastly an important point to mention  regarding isotopes is that chemical properties  of atoms are controlled by the number of electrons, which are determined by the number of protons in the nucleus. Number of neutrons present in the nucleus have very little effect on the chemical properties of an element. Therefore, all the isotopes of a given element show same chemical behaviour.

Number of neutrons is always given by A–Z, whether the species is neutral or ion. 2.2.5 Drawbacks of  rutherford model As you have learnt above, Rutherford nuclear  model of an atom is like a small scale solar system with the nucleus  playing the role  * Classical mechanics is a theoretical science based on Newton’s laws of motion. It specifies the laws of motion of macroscopic objects.of the massive sun and the electrons being  similar to the lighter planets. When classical mechanics* is applied to the solar system, it shows  that the planets describe well-defined   orbits around t he sun. The gravitational force  between the planets is given by the expression  G.12 2mm r/unif0e6 /unif0e8/unif0e7/unif0f6 /unif0f8/unif0f7 where m1 and m2 are the masses,  r is the distance of separation of the masses  and G is the gravitational constant. The theory can also calculate precisely the planetary orbits and these are in agreement with the experimental measurements. The similarity between the solar system  and nuclear model suggests that electrons should move around the nucleus in well defined  orbits. Further, the coulomb force  (kq1q2/r2 where q1 and q2 are the charges, r',\n",
              " 'is the distance of separation of the charges and k is the proportionality constant) between electron and the nucleus is mathematically similar to the gravitational force. However, when a body is moving in an orbit, it undergoes acceleration even if it is moving with a constant speed in an orbit because of changing direction. So an electron in the nuclear model describing planet like orbits is under acceleration. According to the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell, charged particles when accelerated should emit electromagnetic radiation (This feature does not exist for planets since they are uncharged). Therefore, an electron in an orbit will emit radiation, the energy carried by radiation  comes from electronic motion. The orbit will thus continue to shrink. Calculations show that it should take an electron only 10 –8 s  to spiral into the nucleus. But this does not happen. Thus, the Rutherford model   cannot explain the stability of an atom.   If the motion of an electron is described on the basis of the classical mechanics and electromagnetic theory, you may ask that   since the motion of electrons in orbits is   leading to the instability of the atom, then   why not consider electrons as stationary  Unit 2.indd   36 9/9/2022   4:28:09 PM 2024-25 37 structure of atom around the nucleus. If the electrons were   stationary, electrostatic attraction between   the dense nucleus and the electrons would  pull the electrons toward the nucleus to form a miniature version of Thomson’s model of atom. Another serious drawback of the  Rutherford model is that it says nothing about  distribution of the electrons around the nucleus and the energies of these electrons. 2.3  Develo Pments leaDing to t He  boHr’s moDel of atom Histori cally, results observed from the studies  of interactions of radiations with matter have  provided immense information regarding the structure of atoms and molecules. Neils Bohr utilised these results to improve upon the model proposed by Rutherford. Two developments played a major role in the formulation of Bohr’s model of atom. These were: (i)  Dual  character  of the electromagneti c  radiation which means that radiations  possess both wave like and particle like properties, and',\n",
              " '(ii)  Experimental results regarding atomic spectra. First, we will discuss about the  duel nature  of electromagnetic radiations. Experimental results regarding atomic spectra will be discussed in Section 2.4. 2.3.1  Wave nature of electromagnetic    r adiation In the mid-nineteenth century, physicists  actively studied absorption and emission  of  radiation by heated objects. These are called thermal  radiations.  They tried to find out of  what the thermal radiation is made. It is now a well-known  fact that thermal radiations  consist of electromagnetic waves of various frequencies or wavelengths. It is based on a number of modern concepts, which were unknown in the mid-nineteenth century. First active study of thermal radiation laws occured in the 1850’s and the theory of electromagnetic waves and the emission of such waves by accelerating charged particles was  developed  in the early 1870’s by James  Clerk Maxwell, which was experimentally  confirmed  later by Heinrich Hertz. Here, we  will learn some facts about electromagnetic radiations. James  Maxwell (1870) was the first to  give a comprehensive explanation about the  interaction between the charged bodies and the behavio ur of electrical and magnetic  fields on macroscopic  level. He suggested   that when electrically charged particle moves under accelaration, alternating electrical and magnet ic fields are produced and transmitted.   These fields are transmitted  in the forms  of waves called electromagnetic waves or electromagnetic radiation. Light is the form of radiation known from  early  days and speculation about its nature  dates back to remote ancient times. In earlier days (Newton) light was supposed to be made of particles (corpuscules). It was only in the 19th century when wave nature of light was established. Maxwell  was again the first to reveal that  light waves  are associated with oscillating  electric and magnetic character (Fig. 2.6).  Although electromagnetic wave motion is',\n",

These components have the same wavelength, frequency, speed and amplitude, but  they vibrate in two mutually perpendicular planes.

Simplified  picture of electromagnetic   wave is shown in Fig. 2.6. (ii)  Unlike sound waves or waves produced  in water, electromagnetic waves do not requi re medium and can move in  vacuum.  (iii)  It is now well established that there are many types of  electromagnetic  radiations, which differ from one another in wavelength (or frequency). These constitute what is called electromagnetic spectrum (Fig. 2.7). Different  regions of the spectrum  are  identified  by different names. Some  examples are: radio frequency region around 10 6 Hz, used for broadcasting;  microwave region around 1010 Hz used  for radar; infrared region around 1013  Hz used for heating; ultraviolet region around 10 16Hz a component of sun’s  radiation. The small portion around 1015  Hz, is what is ordinarily called visible light. It is only this part which our eyes can see (or detect). Special instruments are required to detect non-visible radiation.(iv)    Differ ent kinds of units are used to  represent electromagnetic radiation. These radia tions are characterised by  the properties, namely, frequency (ν ) and  wavelength (λ). The SI unit for frequency (ν ) is hertz   (Hz, s–1), after Heinrich Hertz. It is defined as  the number of waves that pass a given point  in one second. Wavelength should have',\n",

Fig. 2.7 shows various types of electro-magnetic radiations which differ from one another in wavelengths and frequencies. In vaccum all types of electromagnetic  radiations, regardless of wavelength, travel at  the same speed, i.e., 3.0 × 10 8 m s–1 (2.997925  × 108 ms–1, to be precise). This is called speed  of light and is given the symbol ‘c’. The frequency (ν ), wavelength (λ) and velocity of  light (c) are related by the equation (2.5).  c = ν  λ              (2.5) Fig. 2.7  (a) The spectrum of electromagnetic radiation.

However, following are some of the observations which could not be explained with the help of even the electromagentic theory of 19th century physics (known as classical physics):  (i)  the nature of emission of radiation from  hot bodies (black-body radiation) (ii) ejection of electrons from metal surface when radiation  strikes it (photoelectric  effect) (iii) variation of heat capacity of solids as a function of temperature Unit 2.indd   39 9/9/2022   4:28:10 PM 2024-25 40 chemistry entering the hole will be reflected by the cavity  walls and will be eventually absorbed by the  walls.

It radiates same amount of energy per unit area as it absorbs from its surrounding in any given time. The amount of light emitted (intensity of radiation) from a black body and its spectral distribution depends only on its temperature. At a given temperature, intensity of radiation emitted increases with the increase of wavelength, reaches a maximum value at a given wavelength and then starts decreasing with further increase of wavelength, as shown in Fig. 2.8. Also, as the temperature increases, maxima of the curve shifts to short wavelength. Several attempts were made to predict the intensity of radiation  as a function of wavelength. But the results of the above experiment  could not be explained satisfactorily on  the basis of the wave theory of light. Max Planck arrived at a satisfactory relationship   Fig. 2.8(a)  Black body Fig. 2.8  Wavelength-intensity relationship(iv) Line spectra of atoms with special reference to hydrogen. These phenomena indicate that the system  can take energy onl y in discrete amounts.  All possible energies cannot be taken up or  radiated.  It is noteworthy  that the first concrete  explanation for the phenomenon of the black  body radiation mentioned above was given by  Max Planck in 1900. Let us first try to  understand t his phenomenon, which is  given  below: Hot objects emit electromagnetic  radiations over a wide range of wavelengths. At high temperatures, an appreciable proportion of radiation is in the visible region of the spectrum. As the temperature is raised, a higher proportion of short wavelength (blue light) is generated. For example, when an iron rod is heated in a furnace,  it first turns to dull red and then  progressively becomes more and  more red  as the temperature increases. As this is heated further, the radiation emitted becomes',\n",
              " 'white and then becomes blue as the temperature becomes very high. This means that red radiation is most intense at a particular temperature and the blue radiation is more intense at another temperature. This means intensities of radiations of different wavelengths emitted by hot body depend upon its temperature. By late 1850’s it was known that objects made of different material and kept at different temperatures emit different amount of radiation. Also, when the surface of an object is irradiated with light (electromagnetic radiation), a part of radiant energy  is generally reflected as such, a part  is absorbed and a part of it is transmitted. The reason for incomplete absorption is that ordinary objects are as a rule imperfect absorbers of radiation. An ideal body, which emi ts and absorbs radiations of all frequencies  uniformly, is called a black body and the radiation emitted by such a body is called black body radiation. In practice, no such body exists. Carbon black approximates fairly closely to black body. A good physical  approximation to a black body is a cavity with a tiny hole, which has no other opening. Any ray  Unit 2.indd   40 9/9/2022   4:28:10 PM 2024-25 41 structure of atom by making an assumption that absorption  and emmission of radiation arises from oscillator i.e., atoms in the wall of black body. Their frequency of oscillation is changed by interaction with oscilators of electromagnetic radiation. Planck assumed that radiation could be sub-divided into discrete chunks of energy. He suggested that atoms and molecules could emit or absorb energy only in discrete quantities and not in a continuous manner. He gave the name quantum  to the smallest quantity of energy  that can be emitted or absorbed in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The energy (E) of a quantum of radiation is proportional   to its frequency (ν ) and is expressed by  equation (2.6).       E = hυ                                              (2.6) The proportionality constant, ‘h’ is known  as Planck’s constant and has the value',\n",

With this theory, Planck was able to explain  the distribution of intensity in the radiation  from black body as a function of frequency or wavelength at different temperatures.  Quantisati on has been compared to  standing on a staircase. A person can stand  on any step of a staircase, but it is not possible for him/her to stand in between the two steps. The energy can take any one of the values from the following set, but cannot take on any  values between them. E = 0, hυ, 2hυ , 3hυ.... nhυ..... Photoelectric Effect In 1887, H. Hertz performed a very interesting  experiment in which electrons (or electric current) were ejected when certain metals (for example potassium, rubidium, caesium etc.) were exposed to a beam of light as shown   in Fig.  2.9. The phenomenon is called  Photoelectric effect. The results observed  in this experiment were:  (i) The electrons are ejected from the metal  surface as soon as the beam of light strikes the surface, i.e., there is no time lag between the striking of light beam and the ejection of electrons from the metal surface. ( ii) The number of electrons ejected is proportional to the intensity or brightness of light.  (iii)  For each metal, there is a characteristic minimum frequency,  ν0 (also known  as threshold frequency ) below which  photoelectric effect is not observed. At a frequency ν >ν 0, the ejected electrons  come out with certain kinetic energy. The kinetic energies of these electrons increase with the increase of frequency of the light used. All the above results could not be explained  on the basis of laws of classical physics. According to latter, the energy content of the beam of light depends upon the brightness of the light. In other words, number of electrons ejected and kinetic energy associated with them should depend on the brightness of light. It has been observed that though the number  Fig.2.9  Equipment for studying the photoelectric   effect. Light of a particular frequency',\n",

Electrons are ejected from the metal and are counted by a detector that measures their kinetic energy.Max Planck (1858–1947) Max Planck, a German physicist, received his Ph.D in theoretical physics from the University of Munich in 1879. In 1888, he was appointed Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Berlin.  Planck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918 for his quantum theory. Planck also made significant contributions in thermodynamics and other areas of physics. Unit 2.indd   41 9/9/2022   4:28:11 PM 2024-25 42 chemistry of electrons ejected does depend upon the  brightness of light, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons does not. For example, red light [ν = (4.3 to 4.6) × 10 14 Hz] of any brightness  (intensity) may shine on a piece of potassium metal for hours but no photoelectrons are ejected. But, as soon as even a very weak yellow light (ν = 5.1–5.2 × 10 14 Hz) shines on  the potassium metal, the photoelectric effect is observed. The threshold frequency (ν 0) for  potassium metal is 5.0×1014 Hz.  Einstein (1905) was able to explain the  photoelectric effect using Planck’s quantum theory of electromagnetic radiation as a starting point. the minimum energy required to eject the  electron is h ν 0 (also called work function,  W0; Table 2.2), then the difference in energy   (hν – hν0 ) is transferred as the kinetic energy of  the photoelectron. Following the conservation of energy principle, the kinetic energy of the ejected electron is given by the equation 2.7.   (2.7) where me is the mass of the electron and v  is the  velocity associated with the ejected electron. Lastly, a more intense beam of light consists of larger number of photons, consequently the number of electrons ejected is also larger as compared to that in an experiment in which a beam of weaker intensity of light is employed.  Dual Behaviour of Electromagnetic  Radiation',\n",
              " 'Radiation The particle nature of light posed a dilemma for  scientists. On the one hand, it could explain the black body radiation and  photoelectric effect satisfactorily but on the other hand, it was not consistent with the known wave behaviour of light which could account for the phenomena of interference and diffraction. The only way to resolve the dilemma was to accept the idea that light possesses both particle and wave-like properties, i.e., light  has dual behaviour.  Depending  on  the experiment,  we find that light behaves  either as a wave or as a stream of particles.  Whenever radiation interacts with matter,  it  displays particle like properties in contrast to the wavelike properties (interference and diffraction), which it exhibits when it propagates. This concept was totally alien to the way the scientists thought about matter and radiation and it took them a long time to become convinced of its validity. It turns out, as you shall see later, that some microscopic  particles like electrons also exhibit this wave-particle duality.Shining a beam of light on to a metal  surface can, therefore, be viewed as shooting  a beam of particles, the photons. When a photon  of sufficient energy strikes an electron  in the atom  of the metal, it transfers its energy  instantaneously to the electron during the collision and the electron is ejected without any time lag or delay. Greater the energy possessed by the photon, greater will be transfer of energy to the electron and greater the kinetic energy of the ejected electron. In other words, kinetic energy of the ejected electron is proportional to the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation.

As a  result, the beam of light is deviated or refracted from its original path as it passes from one medium to another. It is observed that when a ray of white light is passed through a prism, the wave with shorter wavelength bends more than the one with a longer wavelength. Since ordinary white light consists of waves with all the wavelengths in the visible range, a ray of white light is spread out into a series of coloured bands called spectrum. The light of red colour which has longest wavelength is deviated the least while the violet light, which has shortest wavelength is deviated the most. The spectrum of white light, that we can see, ranges from violet at 7.50 ×  10 14 Hz to  red at 4× 1014 Hz. Such a spectrum is called  continuous spectrum. Continuous because violet merges into blue, blue into green and so on. A similar spectrum is produced when a rainbow forms in the sky. Remember that visible light is just a small portion of the electromagnetic radiation (Fig.2.7). When electromagnetic radiation interacts with matter, atoms and molecules may absorb energy and reach to a higher energy state. With higher energy, these are in an unstable state. For returning to their normal (more stable, lower energy states) energy state, the atoms and molecules emit radiations in various  regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Emission and Absorption Spectra The spectrum of radiation emitted by a substance that has absorbed energy is called an emission spectrum. Atoms, molecules or  ions that have absorbed radiation are said to be “excited” . To produce an emission  spectrum, energy is supplied to a sample by heating it or irradiating it and the wavelength (or frequency) of the radiation emitted, as the sample gives up the absorbed energy, is recorded. An absorption spectrum is like the',\n",
              " 'An absorption spectrum is like the  photographic negative of an emission spectrum. A continuum of radiation is passed  through a sample which absorbs radiation of certain wavelengths. The missing wavelength which corresponds to the radiation absorbed by the matter, leave dark spaces in the bright continuous spectrum. The study of emission or absorption  spectra is referred to as spectroscopy. The  spectrum of the visible light, as discussed above, was continuous as all wavelengths (red to violet) of the visible light are represented in the spectra. The emission spectra of atoms in the gas phase, on the other hand, do not show a continuous spread of wavelength from red to  violet, rather they emit light only at specific  wavelengths with dark spaces between them. Such spectra  are called line spectra or  atomic spectra because the emitted radiation is  identified  by the appearance  of bright lines  in the spectra (Fig. 2.10 page 45). line emission spectra are of great  interest in the study of electronic structure. Each element has a unique line emission spectrum. The characteristic lines in atomic spectra can be used in chemical analysis to identify unknown atoms in the same way as  fingerprints  are used to identify people.  The exact matching of lines of the emission spectrum of the atoms of a known element with the  lines from an unknown sample  quickly establishes the identity of the latter, German chemist, Robert Bunsen (1811-1899) was  one of the first investigators  to use line  spectra to identify elements. Elements like rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs)  thallium (Tl), indium (In), gallium (Ga) and scandium (Sc) were discovered when their minerals were analysed by spectroscopic me thods. The element helium (He) was  discovered in the sun by spectroscopic method.

The series of lines described by this formula  are called the balmer series. The Balmer  seri es of lines are the only lines in the hydrogen  spectrum which appear in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Swedish spectroscopist,  Johannes  Rydberg,  noted  that all series of lines in the hydrogen spectrum could be described by the following   expression :          (2.9) where n1=1,2........ n2 = n1 + 1, n1 + 2......The value 109,677 cm–1 is called the  rydberg constant  for hydrogen.

Bohr’s model  for hydrogen atom is based on the following  postulates: i) The electron in the hydrogen atom  can  move around the nucleus in a circular  path of fixed radius and energy. These  paths are called orbits, stationary states or allowed energy states. These orbits are arranged concentrically around the nucleus. ii)  The energy of an electron in the orbit does not change w ith time. However,  the electron will move from a lower stationary state to a higher stationary state when required amount of energy is absorbed by the electron or energy is emitted when electron moves from higher stationary state to lower stationary state (equation 2.16). The energy change does not take place in a continuous manner. angular momentum Just as linear momentum  is the product  of mass (m) and linear velocity (v), angular  momentum is the product of moment of inertia (I )  and angular velocity (ω). For an  electron of mass me, moving in a circular  path of radius r around the nucleus,    angular momentum = I × ω Since I  = mer2, and  ω = v/r where v is the  linear velocity,  ∴angular momentum =  mer2 × v/r = mevr iii) The frequency of radiation absorbed or  emitted w hen transition occurs between  two stationary states that differ in  energy by ∆E, is given by:                         (2.10)  Where E1 and E2 are the energies of the  lower and higher allowed energy states  respectively. This expression is commonly  known as Bohr’s frequency rule. iv) The angular momentum of an electron is quantised. In a given stationary state it can be expressed as in equation  (2.11)    mr nh ev/unif03d.2/unif070  n = 1,2,3.....        (2.11)',\n",

Thus an electron can move only in those  orbits for which its angular momentum is  integral multiple of h /2π.  That means angular  momentum is quantised. Radiation is emitted or obsorbed only when transition of electron takes place from one quantised value of angular momentum to another. Therefore, Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory does not apply  here that is why only certain fixed orbits  are allowed. The details regarding the derivation of  energies of the station ary states used by Bohr,  are quite complicated and will be discussed in higher classes. However, according to Bohr’s theory for hydrogen atom:a)  The stationary states for electron are numbered n = 1,2,3.......... These integral  numbers (Section 2.6.2) are known as Principal quantum numbers . b)  The radii of  the stationary states are  expressed as:   rn  = n2 a0                                      (2.12)  where a0 = 52.9 pm. Thus the radius of  the first stationary  state, called the bohr  orbit, is 52.9 pm. Normally the electron in the hydrogen atom is found in this orbit (that is n =1). As n increases the  value of r will increase. In other words the electron will be present away from the nucleus. c)  The most important property associated with the electron, is the energy of its stationary state. It is  given by the  expression. EnnH/unif03d/unif02d/unif0e6 /unif0e8/unif0e7/unif0f6 /unif0f8/unif0f7 R1',\n",

This representation is called an energy level diagram. When  the electron is free from the influence  of nucleus, the energy is taken as zero. The electron  in this situation is associated with the  stationary state of Principal Quantum number = n = ∞ and is called as ionized hydrogen atom.  When the electron is attracted by the nucleus  and is present in orbit n, the energy is emitted   and its energy is lowered. That is the reason  What does the negative electronic  energy (En) for hydrogen atom mean? The energy of the electron in a hydrogen  atom has a negative sign for all possible  orbits (eq. 2.13). What does this negative sign convey? This negative sign means that the energy of the electron in the atom is lower than the energy of a free electron at rest. A free electron at rest is  an electron that is infinitely far away  from the nucleus and is assigned the energy value of zero. Mathematically, this corresponds  to setting n equal to infinity  in the equation (2.13) so that E∞=0. As the  electron gets closer to the nucleus (as n decreases), E n becomes larger in absolute  value and more and more negative. The most negative energy value is given by n=1 which corresponds to the most stable  orbit. We call this the ground state.Niels Bohr',\n",

However, Bohr’s model was  too simple to account for the following points. i)  It fails to account for the finer details  (doublet, that is two closely spaced lines)  of the hydrogen atom spectrum observed by using sop histicated spectroscopic  techniques. This model is also unable to explain the spectrum of atoms other than hydrogen, for example, helium atom which possesses only two electrons. Further, Bohr’s theory was also unable to explain the splitting of spectral lines in the presence of magnetic field (Zeeman effect) or an electric  field (Stark effect). ii) It could not explain the ability of atoms to form molecules by chemical bonds.

This fact has been put to use in making an electron microscope, which is based on the wavelike behaviour of electrons just as an ordinary microscope utilises the wave nature of light. An electron microscope is a powerful tool  in modern scientific research because it  achieves a magnification  of about 15 million  times. It needs to be noted that according to de  Broglie, every object in motion has a wave character. The wavelengths associated with ordinary objects are so short (because of their large masses) that their  wave properties cannot  be detected. The wavelengths associated with electrons and other subatomic particles (with very small mass) can however be detected experimentally.

On  the other hand, if the velocity of the electron is known precisely (∆(v x ) is small), then the  position of the electron will be uncertain   (∆x will be large). Thus, if we carry out some physical measurements on the electron’s position or velocity, the outcome will always depict a fuzzy or blur picture. The uncertainty principle can be best  understood with the help of an example.',\n",

In order to obtain any accuracy, you should use an instrument graduated in units smaller than the thickness of a sheet of the paper. Analogously, in order to determine the position of an electron, we must use a meterstick calibrated in units of smaller than the dimensions of electron (keep in mind that an electron is considered as a point charge and is therefore, dimensionless). To observe an electron, we can illuminate it with “light” or electromagnetic radiation. The “light” used must have a wavelength smaller than the dimensions of an electron. The high  momentum photons of such light  ph=/unif06c/unif0e6 /unif0e8/unif0e7/unif0f6 /unif0f8/unif0f7   would change the energy of electrons by  collisions. In this process we, no doubt, would be able to calculate the position of the electron, but we would know very little about the velocity of the electron after the collision. Significance of Uncertainty Principle One of the important implications of the  Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is that it rules out existence of definite paths or trajectories of electrons and other similar particles. The trajectory of an object is determined by its location and velocity at various moments. If we know where a body is at a particular instant and if we also know its velocity and the forces acting on it at that instant, we can tell where the body would be sometime later. We, therefore, conclude that the position of an object and its velocity fix its trajectory. Since for a sub-atomic object such as an electron, it is not possible simultaneously to determine the position and velocity at any given instant to an arbitrary degree of precision, it is not possible to talk of the trajectory of an electron. the effect of H eisenberg Uncertainty  Principle is significant only for motion of microscopic objects and is negligible for that of macroscopic objects.

For example, for an electron whose mass is 9.11×10 –31 kg., according to  Heisenberg uncertainty principle It, therefore, means that if one tries to  find the exact location of the electron, say  to an uncertainty of only 10–8 m, then the  uncertainty ∆v in velocity would be  10 101042 1 841/unif02d/unif02d /unif02d/unif02d/unif0bbms mms   which is so large that the classical picture  of electrons moving in Bohr’s orbits (fixed)  cannot hold good. it, therefore, means that  the precise statements of the position and momentum of electrons have to be replaced by the statements of probability, that the  electron has at a given position  and momentum. this is what happens in',\n",

Reasons for the Failure of the Bohr Model One can now understand the reasons for the  failure of the Bohr model. In  Bohr model, an electron is regarded as a charged particle moving   in well defined circular orbits about  the nucleus. The wave character of the electron is not considered in  Bohr model. Further,  an orbit is a clearly defined path  and this path can compl etely be defined  only if both the position and the velocity of the electron are known exactly at the same time.

In fact an insight into the structure of the atom was needed which could account for wave-particle duality of matter and be consistent with Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This came with the advent of quantum mechanics. 2.6   QUantUm mecHanical moDel of  atom Classic al mechanics, based on Newton’s  laws of motion, successfully describes the  motion of all macroscopic objects such as a falling stone, orbiting planets etc., which have essentially a particle-like behaviour as shown in the previous section. However it fails when applied to microscopic objects like electrons, atoms, molecules etc. This is mainly because of the fact that classical mechanics ignores the concept of dual behaviour of matter especially for sub-atomic particles and the uncertainty principle. The branch of science that takes into account  this dual behaviour of matter is called quantum mechanics .  Quantum mechanics is a theoretical  science that deals with the study of the motions of the microscopic objects that have both observable wave like and particle like properties.  It specifies the laws of motion that these objects  obey. When quantum mechanics  is applied to macroscopic objects (for which  wave like properties  are insignificant)  the  results are the same as those  from the  classical mechanics.  Quantum mechanics was developed  independently in 1926 by Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger. Here, however, we shall be discussing the quantum mechanics which is based on the ideas of wave motion. The fundamental equation of quantum mechanics was developed by Schrödinger  and it won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933. This equation which incorporates wave-particle duality of matter as proposed by de Broglie is quite complex and knowledge of higher mathematics  is needed to solve it. You will learn its solutions for different systems in higher classes.  For a system (such as an atom or a  molecule whose energy does not change with  time) the  schrödinger equati on is written  as  where  is a mathematical',\n",
              " 'as  where  is a mathematical  operator called Hamiltonian. Schrödinger gave a recipe of constructing this operator from the expression for the total energy of the system. The total energy of the system takes into account the kinetic energies of all the sub-atomic particles (electrons, nuclei), attractive potential between the electrons and nuclei and repulsive potential among the electrons and nuclei individually. Solution of  this equation gives E and  ψ. Hydrogen Atom and the Schrödinger Equation When Schrödinger equation is solved for  hydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy levels the electron can occupy and the corresponding wave function(s) ( ψ) of  the electron associated with each energy level. These quantized energy states and corresponding wave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers (principal quantum number n, azimuthal quantum number l and  magnetic quantum number m l ) arise as a  natural consequence in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. When an electron  is in any energy state, the wave function Erwin Schrödinger, an  Austrian physicist received his Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of Vienna in 1910. In 1927 Schrödinger succeeded Max Planck at the  University of Berlin at Planck’s request. In 1933, Schrödinger left Berlin because of his opposition to Hitler and Nazi policies and returned to Austria in 1936. After the invasion of Austria by Germany, Schrödinger was forcibly removed from his professorship. He then moved to Dublin, Ireland where he remained for seventeen years. Schrödinger shared the Nobel Prize for Physics with P.A.M. Dirac in 1933. Erwin Schrödinger  (1887–1961) Unit 2.indd   53 9/9/2022   4:28:17 PM 2024-25 54 chemistry corresponding to that energy state contains  all information about the electron. The wave function is a mathematical function whose value depends upon the coordinates of the electron in the atom and does not carry any physical meaning. Such wave functions of hydrogen or hydrogen like species with one electron are called atomic orbitals. Such wave functions pertaining to one-electron species are called one-electron systems. The probability',\n",
              " 'of finding an electron at a point  within an atom is proportional to the  |ψ|2 at  that point.  The quantum mechanical results of the hydrogen atom successfully predict all aspects of the hydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the Bohr model. Application of  Schrödinger equation to  multi-electron  atoms presents a difficulty:  the  Schrödinger equation cannot be solved exactly for  a multi-electron  atom. This difficulty can  be overcome by using approximate methods. Such calculat ions with the aid of modern  computers show that orbitals in atoms other than hydrogen do not differ in any radical way from the hydrogen orbitals discussed above. The principal difference lies in the consequence of increased nuclear charge. Because of this  all the orbitals are somewhat contracted. Further, as you shall see later (in subsections 2.6.3 and 2.6.4), unlike orbitals of hydrogen or hydrogen like species, whose energies depend only on the quantum number n, the energies of the orbitals in multi-electron  atoms depend on quantum numbers n and l. important features of the Quantum  mechanical model of atom Quantum mechanical model of atom is  the picture of the structure of the atom,  which emerges from the application of  the Schrödinger equation to atoms. The following are the important features of the  quantum-mechanical model of atom: 1.  The energy of electrons in atoms is   quantized (i.e., can only have certain  specific values), for example when electrons are bound to the nucleus in atoms.2. The existence of quantised electronic energy levels is a direct result of the wave like properties of electrons and are  allowed solutions of Schrödinger  wave equation. 3. Both the exact position and exact velocity of an electron in  an atom  cannot be determined simultaneously (Heisenberg uncertainty principle). The path of an electron in an atom  therefore, can never be determined or known accurately. That is why, as you shall see later on, one talks of only probability of finding  the electron at different points in   an atom.',\n",
              " 'an atom. 4. an atomic orbital is the  wave  function ψ for an electron in an atom.  Whenever an electron is described by a wave function, we say that the electron occupies that orbital. Since many such wave functions are possible for an electron, there are many atomic orbitals in an atom. These “one electron orbital wave functions” or orbitals form the basis of the electronic structure of atoms. In each orbital, the electron has  a definite energy. An orbital cannot  contain more than two electrons. In  a  multi-electron atom, the electrons are filled  in various orbitals in the order of  increasing energy. For each electron of a multi-electron atom, there shall, therefore,  be an orbital wave function  characteristic of the orbital it occupies. All the information about the electron in an atom is stored in its orbital wave function  ψ and quantum mechanics  makes it possible to extract this information out of  ψ. 5.  The probability  of finding an electron at  a point within an atom is  proportional to  the square of the orbital wave function i.e., | ψ|2 at that point. | ψ|2 is known  as probability density and is always  positive. From the value of |ψ|2 at  different points within an atom, it is possible to predict the region around the nucleus where electron will most probably be found. 2.6.1  orbitals and Quantum numbers  A large number  of orbitals are possible in  an atom. Qualitatively these orbitals can  Unit 2.indd   54 9/9/2022   4:28:17 PM 2024-25 55 structure of atom be distinguished by their size, shape and  orientation. An orbital of smaller size means there  is more chance of finding the electron  near the nucleus. Similarly  shape and  orientation mean that there is more probability of  finding the electron along certain directions',\n",
              " 'than along others. Atomic orbitals are precisely distinguished by what are known as quantum numbers. Each orbital is  designated by three  quantum numbers labelled as n, l and ml.  the principal quantum number ‘n’ is  a  positive integer with value of n = 1,2,3....... The principal quantum number determines  the size and to large extent the energy of the  orbital.  For hydrogen atom and hydrogen like  species (He +, Li2+, .... etc.) energy and size of  the orbital depends only on ‘n’. The principal quantum number also  identifies the shell. With the increase in the  value of ‘ n’, the nu mber of allowed orbital  increases and are given by ‘n2’ all the  orbitals of a given value of ‘n’ constitute  a single shell of atom and are represented by the following letters       n  =  1   2   3   4   ............

Since energy is required in shifting away the negatively charged electron from the positively charged nucleus, the energy of the orbital will increase with increase of n.  azimuthal quantum number. ‘l’ is also  known as  orbital angular momentum or  subsidiary quantum number.  It defines the  three-dimensional shape of the orbital. For a given value of n, l  can have n values ranging  from  0 to n – 1, that is, for a given value of n,  the possible value of l are : l = 0, 1, 2, ..........  (n–1) For example, when n = 1, value of l is only  0. For n = 2, the possible value of l can be 0 and 1. For n = 3, the possible l values are 0,  1 and 2. Each shell consists of one or more',\n",
              " 'Each shell consists of one or more   sub-shells or sub-levels. The number of  sub-shells in a principal shell is equal to the  value of n.  For example in the first shell (n = 1),  there is only one sub-shell which corresponds to l  = 0. There are two sub-shells (l = 0, 1) in  the second shell (n = 2), three (l = 0, 1, 2) in third shell (n  = 3) and so on. Each sub-shell is  assigned an azimuthal quantum number (l ).  Sub-shells corresponding to different values of l are represented by the following symbols. Value for l :  0   1 2   3 4   5 ............ notation for  s   p d   f g   h ............ sub-shell  Table 2.4 shows the permissible values of  ‘l ’ for a given principal quantum number and  the corresponding sub-shell notation. magnetic orbital quantum number.   ‘ml’ gives information about the spatial  orientation of the orbital with respect to standard set of co-ordinate axis.

For l = 2, ml = –2, –1, 0, +1 and +2,  [2(2)+1 = 5, five d orbitals].

But all these quantum numbers are not enough to explain the line spectr a observed in the case of multi-electron  atoms, that is, some of the lines actually occur in doublets (two lines closely spaced), triplets (three lines, closely spaced) etc. This suggests the presence of a few more energy levels than predicted by the three quantum numbers. In 1925, George Uhlenbeck and Samuel  Goudsmit proposed the presence of the fourth  quantum number known as the electron spin quantum number (m s). An electron  spins around its own axis, much in a similar way as earth spins around its own axis while revolving around the sun. In other words, an electron has, besides charge and mass, intrinsic spin angular quantum number. Spin angular momentum of the electron — a vector  quantity, can have two orientations relative to the chosen axis. These two orientations are distinguished by the spin quantum numbers m s which can take the values of +½ or –½.  These are called the two spin states of the electron and are normally  represented by  two arrows, ↑ (spin up) and ↓ (spin down). Two  electrons that have different ms values (one +½  and the other –½) are said to have opposite',\n",
              " 'spins. An orbital cannot hold more than two electrons and these two electrons should have opposite spins. To sum up, the four quantum numbers  provide the following information : i)  n defines the shell,  determines  the size  of the orbital and also to a large extent the energy of the orbital. ii)  There are n subshells in the nth shell. l  identifies the subshell and determines   the shape of the orbital  (see section  2.6.2). There are (2l+1) orbitals of each type in a subshell, that is, one s orbital (l = 0), three p orbitals (l  = 1) and five  d orbitals (l  = 2) per subshell. To some  extent l also determines the energy of  the orbital in a multi-electron atom. iii) ml designates the orientation of the  orbital. For a given value of l , ml has  (2l+1) values, the same as the number of orbitals per subshell. It means that  orbit, orbital and its importance Orbit and orbital are not synonymous. An orbit, as proposed by Bohr, is a circular path around the  nucleus in which an electron moves. A precise description of this path of the electron is impossible according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr orbits, therefore, have no real meaning and their existence can never be demonstrated experimentally. An atomic orbital, on the other hand, is a quantum mechanical concept and refers to the one electron wave function  ψ in an atom. It is  characterized by three quantum numbers (n, l and ml) and its value depends upon the coordinates  of the electron. ψ has, by itself, no physical meaning. It is the square of the wave function i.e., | ψ|2  which has a physical meaning. | ψ|2 at any point in an atom gives the value of probability density  at that point. Probability density (| ψ|2) is the probability per unit volume and the product of | ψ|2',\n",
              " 'and a small volume (called a volume element) yields the probability  of finding the electron in that  volume (the reason for specifying a small volume  element is that | ψ|2 varies from one region to  another in space but its value can be assumed to be constant within a small volume element). The  total probability  of finding the electron in a given volume can then be calculated  by the sum  of all the products of | ψ|2 and the corresponding volume elements. It is thus possible to get the  probable distribution of an electron in an orbital. Unit 2.indd   56 9/9/2022   4:28:17 PM 2024-25 57 structure of atom the number of orbitals is equal to the  number of ways in which they are oriented.  iv)  ms refers to orientation of the spin of the  electron. According to the German physicist,  Max Born, the square of the wave function   (i.e.,ψ 2) at a point gives the probability density  of the electron at that point. The variation of  ψ 2 as a function of r for 1s and 2s orbitals  is given in Fig. 2.12(b). Here again, you may note that the curves for 1s and 2s orbitals are different. It may be noted that for 1s  orbital the  probability density is maximum at the nucleus and it decreases sharply as we move away from it. On the other hand, for 2s orbital  the probability  density first decreases   sharply to zero and again starts increasing. After  reaching a small maxima it decreases  again and approaches zero as the value of r increases further. The region where this  probability density function reduces to zero  is called nodal surfaces or simply nodes.  In general, it has been found that ns-orbital has (n – 1) nodes, that is, number of nodes increases with increase of principal quantum number n. In other words, number of nodes',\n",

Problem 2.17  What is the total number of orbitals  associated with the principal quantum number n = 3 ? solution For n = 3, the  possible values of l are  0, 1 and 2. Thus there is one 3s orbital   (n = 3, l = 0 and ml = 0); there are three  3p orbitals (n = 3, l = 1 and ml = –1, 0,  +1); there are five 3d orbitals (n = 3,  l =  2 and ml = –2, –1, 0, +1+, +2).

In this representation, a boundary surface or contour surface is drawn in space for an orbital on which the value of probability density | ψ|2 is constant.  In principle many such boundary surfaces may be possible. However, for a given orbital, only that boundary surface diagram of constant probability density* is taken to be good representation of the shape of the orbital which encloses a region or volume in which  the probability  of finding the electron  is very high, say, 90%. The boundary surface  diagram for 1s  and 2s orbitals are given in   Fig. 2.13(b). One may ask a question : Why do we not draw a boundary surface diagram, which bounds a region in which the probability of  finding the electron is, 100 %? The answer  to this question is that the probability density | ψ|2 has always some value, howsoever  small it may be, at any finite distance from  the nucleus. It is therefore, not  possible to  draw a boundary surface diagram of a rigid size  in which the probability  of finding the  electron is 100%. Boundary surface diagram for a  s orbital is actually a sphere centred on  the nucleus. In two dimensions, this sphere looks like a circle. It encloses a region in which  probability  of finding the electron is',\n",
              " 'about 90%. Thus, we s ee that 1 s and 2s orbitals are  spherical in shape. In reality all the s-orbitals are spherically symmetric, that is, the probability  of finding the electron at a given  distance is equal in all the directions. It is also observed that the size of the s orbital increases with increase in  n, that is, 4s > 3s > 2s > 1s  and the electron is located further away from the nucleus as the principal quantum number increases. Boundary surface diagrams for three  2p orbitals (l = 1) are shown in Fig. 2.14. In these diagrams, the nucleus is at the origin. Here, unlike s-orbitals, the boundary surface diagrams are not spherical. Instead each   p orbital consists of two sections called lobes that are on either side of the plane that passes through the nucleus.

The size, shape and energy of the three orbitals are identical. They differ however, in the way the lobes are oriented. Since the lobes may be considered to lie along the x, y or z axis, they are given the designations 2p x, 2py, and 2pz. It should be  understood, however, that there is no simple relation between the values of m l (–1, 0 and +1)',\n",
              " 'and the x, y and z directions. For our purpose, it is sufficient  to remember  that, because  there are three possible values of ml, there  are, therefore, three p  orbitals whose axes  are mutually perpendicular. Like s orbitals, p orbitals increase in size and energy with increase in the principal quantum number and hence the order of the energy and size of various p orbitals is 4p  > 3p > 2p. Further, like  s orbitals, the probability density functions for p-orbital also pass through value zero, besides  at  zero and infinite distance, as the distance  from the nucleus increases. The number of nodes are given by the n –2, that is number  of radial node is 1 for 3p orbital,  two for 4p  orbital and so on. For l = 2, the orbital is known as d-orbital  and the minimum value of principal quantum number (n ) has to be 3. as the value of l  cannot  be greater than n–1.  There are five ml values  (–2, –1, 0, +1 and +2) for l = 2 and thus there are  five d orbitals. The boundary surface  diagram  of d orbitals are shown in Fig. 2.15. The five d-orbitals are designated as dxy,  dyz, dxz, dx2–y2 and dz2. The shapes of the first  four d-orbitals are similar to each other, where  as that of the fifth one, dz2, is different from  others, but all five 3d orbitals are equivalent  in energy. The d  orbitals for which n  is greater  than 3  (4d, 5d...) also have shapes similar to  3d orbital, but differ in energy and size. Besides the radial nodes (i.e., probability  density function is zero), the probability density functions for the np and nd orbitals are zero at the plane (s), passing through the nucleus (origin). For example, in case of p z',\n",
              " 'z  orbital, xy-plane is a nodal plane, in case of d xy orbital, there are two nodal planes passing  through the origin and bisecting the xy plane containing z-axis. These are called angular nodes and number of angular nodes are given by ‘l’, i.e., one angular node for p orbitals, two  angular nodes for ‘d’ orbitals and so on.  the  total number of nodes are given by ( n–1),  i.e., sum of l angular nodes and (n – l – 1)  radial nodes. 2.6.3 energies of orbitals The energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom  is determi ned solely by the principal quantum Fig. 2.15  Boundary surface diagrams of the five  3d orbitals. Unit 2.indd   59 9/9/2022   4:28:20 PM 2024-25 60 chemistry number. Thus the energy of the orbitals in  hydrogen atom  increases as follows : 1s < 2s = 2p < 3s = 3p = 3d <4s = 4p = 4d  = 4f <                                               (2.23)   and is depicted in Fig. 2.16. Although the  shapes of 2s  and 2p  orbitals are different,   an electron has the same energy when it is in the 2s orbital as when it is present in 2p orbital. The orbitals having the same energy are called degenerate.  The 1s orbital in a  hydrogen atom, as said earlier, corresponds to the most stable condition and is called the ground state and an electron residing in this orbital is most strongly held by the nucleus. An electron in the 2s, 2p or higher orbitals in a hydrogen atom is in excited state.The energy of an electron in a multi-   electron atom, unlike that of the hydrogen',\n",
              " 'atom, depends not only on its principal quantum number (shell), but also on its azimuthal quantum number (subshell). That is, for a given principal quantum number, s,   p, d, f ... all have different energies. Within  a given principal quantum number, the energy of orbitals increases in the order s<p<d<f. For higher energy levels, these  differences  are sufficiently  pronounced  and  straggering of orbital  energy may result,  e.g., 4s <3d and 6s <5d; 4f<6p. The main  reason for having different energies of the subshells is the mutual repulsion among the electrons in multi-electron atoms. The only electrical interaction present in hydrogen atom is the attraction between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged  nucleus. In multi-electron atoms, besides the presence of attraction between the electron and nucleus, there are repulsion terms between every electron and other electrons present in the atom. Thus the stability of an electron in a multi-electron atom is because total attractive interactions are more than the repulsive interactions. In general, the repulsive interaction of the electrons in the outer shell with the electrons in the inner shell are more important. On the other hand, the attractive interactions of an electron increases with increase of positive charge (Ze) on the nucleus.  Due to the presence of electrons in  the inner shells, the electron in the outer shell will not experience the full positive charge of the nucleus ( Ze). The effect will be lowered  due to the partial screening of positive charge on the nucleus by the inner shell electrons. This is known as the shielding of the outer  shell electrons from the nucleus  by the inner shell electrons, and the net positive charge experienced by the outer electrons is known as effective nuclear charge (Z eff e).  Despite the shielding of the outer electrons  from the nucleus by the inner shell electrons, the attractive force experienced by the outer shell electrons increases with increase of nuclear charge. In other words, the energy of interaction between, the nucleus and electron Fig. 2.16  Energy level diagrams for the few  electronic shells of (a) hydrogen  atom',\n",

Note that orbitals for the same value of principal quantum number, have the same energies even for different azimuthal quantum number for hydrogen atom. In case of multi-electron atoms, orbitals with same principal quantum number possess different energies for different azimuthal quantum numbers. Unit 2.indd   60 9/9/2022   4:28:20 PM 2024-25 61 structure of atom (that is orbital energy) decreases (that is   more negative) with the increase of atomic  number (Z ). Both the attractive and repulsive  interactions depend upon the shell and shape  of the orbital in which the electron is present. For example electrons present in spherical shaped, s orbital shields the outer electrons  from the nucleus more effectively as compared to electrons present in p  orbital. Similarly  electrons present in p  orbitals shield the outer  electrons from the nucleus more than the electrons present in d  orbitals, even though all   these orbitals are present in the same shell. Further within a shell, due to spherical shape of s orbital, the s  orbital electron spends more  time close to the nucleus in comparison to p orbital electron which spends more time in the vicinity of nucleus in comparison to d orbital electron. In other words, for a given  shell (principal quantum number), the Z eff  experienced by the electron decreases with  increase of azimuthal quantum number (l), that is, the s orbital electron will be more tightly bound to the nucleus than p orbital electron which in turn will be better tightly bound than the d orbital electron. The energy of electrons in s orbital will be lower (more negative) than that of p orbital electron  which will have less energy than that of d orbital electron and so on. Since the extent of shielding from the nucleus is different for electrons in different orbitals, it leads to the splitting of energy levels within the same shell (or same principal quantum number), that is, energy of electron in an orbital, as mentioned earlier, depends upon the values of n and l. Mathematically, the dependence',\n",
              " 'of energies of the orbitals on n and l are quite complicated but one simple rule is that, the lower the value of (n + l) for an orbital, the lower is its energy.  if two orbitals have  the same value of (n + l ), the orbital with  lower value of n  will have the lower energy.   The Table 2.5 illustrates the (n + l ) rule and  Fig. 2.16 depicts the energy levels of multi-electrons atoms. It may be noted that different subshells of a particular shell have different energies in case of multi-electrons atoms. However, in hydrogen atom, these have the same energy. Lastly it may be mentioned here that energies of the orbitals in the same  subshell decrease with increase in the atomic number (Z eff). For example, energy of  2s orbital of hydrogen atom is greater than that of 2s  orbital of lithium and that of lithium  is greater than that of sodium and so on, that  is, E 2s(H) > E2s(Li) > E2s(Na) > E2s(K). 2.6.4 filling of orbitals in atom The filling of electrons  into the orbitals of  different atoms takes place according to the aufbau principle which is  based on the  Pauli’s exclusion principle, the Hund’s rule of maximum multiplicity and the relative energies of the orbitals. Aufbau Principle The word ‘aufbau’ in German means ‘building  up’. The building up of orbitals means the table 2.5  arrangement of orbitals with  increasing energy on the basis  of (n+l ) rule Unit 2.indd   61 9/9/2022   4:28:20 PM 2024-25 62 chemistry filling up of orbitals with electrons. The  principle states : in the ground state of the  atoms, the orbitals are  filled in order of  their increasing energies. In other words, electrons  first occupy the lowest energy orbital',\n",
              " 'available to them and enter into higher energy orbitals only after the lower  energy orbitals  are filled. As you have learnt above, energy  of a given orbi tal depends upon effective  nuclear charge and different type of orbitals are affected to different extent. Thus, there is no single ordering of energies of orbitals which will be universally correct for all atoms. However, following order of  energies of  the orbitals is extremely useful: 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s... The order may be remembered by using  the method given in Fig. 2.17. Starting from the top, the direction of the arrows gives the  order  of filling of orbitals, that is starting  from right top to bottom left. With respect to placement of outermost valence electrons, it is remarkably accurate for  all atoms. For  example, valence  electron in potassium  must choose between 3d and 4s orbitals and  as predicted by this sequence, it is found in 4s  orbital. The above order should be  assumed  to be a rough guide to the filling  of energy levels. In many cases, the orbitals are similar  in energy and small changes in  atomic structure may bring about a change in  the order of filling. Even then, the above  series is a useful guide to the building of the electronic structure of an atom provided that it is remembered that exceptions may occur. Pauli Exclusion Principle The  number of electrons to be filled in various  orbitals is restricted by the exclusion  principle,  given by the Austrian scientist Wolfgang Pauli  (1926). According to this principle : no two  electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quan tum numbers. Pauli exclusion  principle can also be stated as : “ only two',\n",
              " 'electrons may exist in the same orbital and these electrons must have opposite spin.” This means that  the two electrons can have  the same value of three quantum numbers n, l and m l, but must have the opposite spin  quantum number. The restriction imposed by Pauli’s exclusion principle on the number of electrons in an orbital helps in calculating the capacity of electrons to be present in any subshell. For example, subshell 1s  comprises  one orbital and thus the maximum number of electrons present in 1s  subshell can be two, in  p and d subshells, the maximum number of electrons can be 6 and 10 and so on. This can be summed up as : the maximum number of electrons in the shell with principal quantum number n is equal to 2n 2. Hund’s Rule of Maximum Multiplicity This rule deals with the filling of electrons into  the orbitals belonging to the same subshell  (that is, orbitals of equal energy, called degenerate orbitals). It states : pairing of Fig.2.17  Order of filling of orbitals Unit 2.indd   62 9/9/2022   4:28:20 PM 2024-25 63 structure of atom electrons in the orbitals belonging to the  same subshell (p , d or f ) does not take  place until each orbital belonging to that subshell has got one electron each i.e., it is singly occupied. Since there are three p,  five d and seven f  orbitals, therefore, the pairing of electrons will start in the p , d and f orbitals with the entry  of 4th, 6th and 8th electron, respectively. It has  been observed that half filled and fully  filled degenerate  set of orbitals acquire extra  stability due to their symmetry (see Section, 2.6.7). 2.6.5  Electronic Configuration of Atoms The distribution of electrons  into orbitals of an  atom is called its electronic configuration.  If one keeps in mind the basic rules which govern',\n",
              " 'the filling of different atomic orbitals,  the electronic configurations of different atoms can be written very easily. The  electronic  configuration  of different  atoms can be represented in two ways. For   example : (i)   sa  pbdc ...... notation (ii)  Orbital diagram  s                     p                        d In the first notation, the su bshell is  represented by the respective letter symbol  and the number of electrons present in the subshell is depicted, as the super script, like  a, b, c, ... etc. The similar subshell represented  for different shells is differentiated by writing the principal quantum number before the respective subshell. In the second notation  each orbital of the subshell is represented by a box and the electron is represented by an arrow (↑) a positive spin or an arrow (↓)  a negative spin. The advantage of second notation  over the first is that it represents  all  the four quantum numbers. The hydrogen atom has only one electron  which goes i n the orbital with the lowest energy,  namely 1s . The electronic  configuration  of the  hydrogen atom is 1 s1 meaning that it has  one electron in the 1s  orbital. The second  electron in helium (He) can also occupy the 1s orbital. Its configuration  is, therefore,  1s2.  As mentioned above, the two electrons differ from each other with opposite spin, as can be  seen from the orbital diagram. The third electron of lithium (Li) is not  allowed in the 1 s orbital because of Pauli  exclusion principle. It, therefore, takes the next available choice, namely the 2s orbital. The  electronic  configuration  of Li is 1s22s1.  The 2s orbital can accommodate one more electron.',\n",
              " 'The configuration  of beryllium  (Be)  atom is, therefore, 1s2 2s2 (see Table 2.6,  page 66 for the electronic  configurations  of  elements). In the next six elements—boron   (B, 1s22s22p1), carbon (C, 1s22s22p2), nitrogen  (N, 1s22s22p3), oxygen (O, 1s22s22p4), fluorine  (F, 1s22s22p5) and neon (Ne, 1s22s22p6), the 2p  orbitals get progressively  filled. This process  is completed with the neon atom. The orbital  picture of  these elements can be represented  as follows : The electronic configuration of the  elements sodium (Na,1s22s22p63s1) to argon   (Ar,1s22s22p63s23p6), follow exactly the same  pattern as the elements from lithium to neon with the difference that the 3s  and 3p  orbitals  are  getting filled now.

The electrons in the completely  filled shells are known as core electrons and  the electrons that are added to the electronic  shell with the highest principal quantum number are called valence electrons.  For',\n",
              " 'For  example, the electrons in Ne are the core electrons and the electrons from Na to Ar are the valence electrons. In potassium (K) and calcium (Ca), the 4s orbital, being lower in energy than the 3d orbitals, is occupied by one and two electrons respectively. A new pattern is followed beginning with  scandium (Sc). The 3d  orbital, being lower  in energy than the 4p  orbital, is filled first.  Consequently, in the next ten elements,  scandium (Sc), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium  (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe),  cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn),  the five 3d orbitals are progressively  occupied. We  may be puzzled by the fact  that chromium  and copper have five and ten  electrons in 3d orbitals  rather than four and  nine as their position would have indicated with two-electrons in the 4s orbital. The reason  is that fully filled orbitals and half- filled orbitals have extra stability (that is,  lower energy). Thus p3, p6, d5, d10,f 7, f14 etc.  configurations,  which are either half-filled   or fully filled, are more stable. Chromium   and copper therefore adopt the d5 and  d10 configuration (Section 2.6.7)[caution:  exceptions do exist]  With the saturation of the 3d  orbitals,  the filling of the 4p orbital starts at gallium  (Ga) and is complete at  krypton (Kr).

Then from lanthanum  (La) to mercury (Hg), the filling up  of electrons takes place in 4 f and 5d orbitals. After this, filling of 6p, then 7s  and finally 5f  and 6d  orbitals takes place. The elements  after uranium (U)  are all short-lived and all of  them are produced  artificially.  The electronic   configurations  of the known elements  (as  determined by spectroscopic methods) are  tabulated in Table 2.6 (page 66). One may ask  what is the utility of knowing  the electron configuration? The modern approach to the chemistry, infact, depends almost entirely on electronic distribution to understand and explain chemical behaviour. For example, questions like why two or more atoms combine to form molecules, why some elements are metals while others are non-metals, why elements like helium and argon are not reactive but elements like the halogens are  reactive, find simple explanation  from the  electronic  configuration.  These questions  have  no answer in the Daltonian  model of atom.  A detailed understanding of the electronic structure of atom is, therefore,  very essential  for getting an insight into the various aspects of modern chemical knowledge. 2.6.6  stability of completely filled and    Half filled subshells The ground state electronic  configuration  of  the atom of an element always corresponds to  the state of the lowest total electronic  energy.  The electronic  configurations  of most of the  atoms follow the basic rules given in Section',\n",
              " '2.6.5. However, in certain elements such as Cu, or Cr, where the two subshells (4s and 3d) differ slightly in their energies, an electron  shifts from a subshell of lower energy (4s ) to a  subshell of higher energy (3d), provided such a shift results in all orbitals of the subshell of higher energy getting either completely filled  or half filled. The valence electronic   configurations  of Cr and Cu, therefore,  are  3d5 4s1 and 3d10 4s1 respectively and not 3d4  4s2 and 3d9 4s2. It has been found that there is  extra stability associated with these electronic configurations. Unit 2.indd   64 9/9/2022   4:28:21 PM 2024-25 65 structure of atom The completely filled and completely   half-filled  subshells  are stable due to the  following reasons: 1.Symmetrical distribution of electrons: It  is well known that symmetry  leads to stability. The completely  filled  or half filled subshells  have symmetrical   distribution of electrons in them and are therefore more stable. Electrons in the same subshell (here 3d) have equal energy but different  spatial distribution.  Consequently, their shielding of one-another is relatively small and the electrons are more strongly attracted by the nucleus.2. Exchange Energy : The stabilizing effect arises whenever two or more electrons with the same spin are present in the degenerate orbitals of a subshell. These electrons tend to exchange their positions and the energy released due to this exchange is called exchange energy. The number of exchanges that can take place is maximum when the subshell is  either half filled or completely  filled   (Fig. 2.18). As a result th e exchange  energy is maximum and so is the stability.  You may note that the exchange',\n",
              " 'You may note that the exchange  energy is at the basis of Hund’s rule that electrons which enter orbitals of equal energy have parallel spins as far as possible. In other words, the extra stability  of half-filled  and completely  filled  subshell is   due to: (i) relatively small  shielding, (ii) smaller coulombic repulsion energy, and (iii) larger exchange energy. Details  about the exchange  energy will be  dealt with in higher classes.Fig. 2.18  Possible exchange for a d5  configurationCauses of Stability of Completely Filled and Half-filled Subshells Unit 2.indd   65 9/9/2022   4:28:21 PM 2024-25 66 chemistry Table 2.6  Electronic Configurations of the Elements * Elements with exceptional electronic configurations Unit 2.indd   66 9/9/2022   4:28:22 PM 2024-25 67 structure of atom ** Elements with atomic number 112 and above have been reported but not yet fully authenticated and named.

The first atomic theory, proposed by John Dalton in 1808, regarded atom as  the ultimate indivisible particle of matter. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, it was  proved experimentally that atoms are divisible and consist of three fundamental particles: electrons, protons and  neutrons . The discovery of sub-atomic particles led to the proposal  of various atomic models to explain the structure of atom. Thomson in 1898 proposed that an atom consists of uniform sphere of positive electricity',\n",
              " 'with electrons embedded into it. This model in which mass of the atom is considered to be evenly spread over the atom was proved wrong by Rutherford’s famous alpha-particle scattering experiment in 1909. Rutherford concluded that atom is made of a tiny positively charged nucleus , at its centre with electrons revolving around it in circular orbits .  rutherford model, which resembles the solar  system, was no doubt an improvement over  thomson model but it could not account for the stability of the atom i.e. , why the electron  does not fall into the nucleus. Further, it was also silent about the electronic structure of atoms i.e., about the distribution and relative energies of electrons around the nucleus. The difficulties  of the Rutherford  model were overcome  by Niels Bohr in 1913 in his model of the  hydrogen atom. Bohr postulated that electron moves around the nucleus in  circular orbits.  Only certain orbits can exist and each orbit corresponds  to a specific energy. Bohr calculated   the energy of electron in various orbits and for each orbit predicted the distance between the electron and nucleus.  bohr model, though offering a satisfactory model for explaining the  spectra of the hydrogen atom, could not explain the spectra of multi-electron  atoms. The  reason for this was soon discovered. In Bohr model, an electron is regarded as a charged particle  moving in a well defined circular orbit about the nucleus. The wave character  of  the electron is ignored in Bohr’s theory. An orbit is a clearly defined path and this path can  completely  be defined only if both the exact position and the exact velocity of the electron  at the same time are known.  This is not possible according to the Heisenberg uncertainty',\n",
              " 'principle. Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only ignores the dual behaviour of electron but also contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle .  Erwin Schrödinger, in 1926, proposed an equation called Schrödinger equation to  describe the electron distributions in space and the allowed energy levels in atoms. This equation incorporates de Broglie’s concept of wave-particle duality and is consistent with  Heisenberg uncertainty principle. When Schrödinger equation is solved for the electron in a hydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy states the electron can occupy [and the corresponding wave function(s) ( ψ) (which in fact are the mathematical functions) of the  electron associated with each energy state]. These quantized energy states and corresponding wave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers ( principal  quantum number n, azimuthal quantum number l and magnetic quantum number m l)  arise as a natural consequence in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. The restrictions on the values of these three quantum numbers also come naturally from this solution. The quantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom successfully predicts all aspects of the hydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the Bohr model. According to the quantum mechanical model of the atom, the electron distribution of an  atom containing a number of electrons is divided into shells. The shells, in turn, are thought  to consist of one or more subshells and subshells are assumed to be composed of one or more orbitals, which the electrons occupy. While for hydrogen and hydrogen like systems (such as He +, Li2+ etc.) all the orbitals within a given shell have same energy, the energy of  the orbitals in a multi-electron atom depends upon the values of n and l: The lower the value  of (n + l ) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same (n + l ) value,  the orbital with lower value of n has the lower energy. In an atom many such orbitals are  Unit 2.indd   68 9/9/2022   4:28:23 PM 2024-25']"

According to them, the continued subdivisions of matter would ultimately yield atoms which would not be further divisible. The word ‘atom’  has been derived from the Greek word ‘a-tomio’  which  means ‘uncut-able’ or ‘non-divisible’. These earlier ideas were mere speculations and there was no way to test them experimentally. These ideas remained dormant  for a very long time and were revived again by scientists in the nineteenth century. The atomic theory of matter was first proposed  on  a firm scientific  basis by John Dalton, a British  school t eacher in 1808. His theory, called Dalton’s  atomic theory, regarded the atom as the ultimate particle  of matter (Unit 1). Dalton’s atomic theory was  able to explain the law of conservation of mass, law of constant composition and l aw of multiple proportion--- --- \n",
            " --- --- is the distance of separation of the charges and k is the proportionality constant) between electron and the nucleus is mathematically similar to the gravitational force. However, when a body is moving in an orbit, it undergoes acceleration even if it is moving with a constant speed in an orbit because of changing direction. So an electron in the nuclear model describing planet like orbits is under acceleration. According to the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell, charged particles when accelerated should emit electromagnetic radiation (This feature does not exist for planets since they are uncharged). Therefore, an electron in an orbit will emit radiation, the energy carried by radiation  comes from electronic motion. The orbit will thus continue to shrink. Calculations show that it should take an electron only 10 –8 s  to spiral into the nucleus. But this does not happen. Thus, the Rutherford model   cannot explain the stability of an atom.   If the motion of an electron is described on the basis of the classical mechanics and electromagnetic theory, you may ask that   since the motion of electrons in orbits is   leading to the instability of the atom, then   why not consider electrons as stationary  Unit 2.indd   36 9/9/2022   4:28:09 PM 2024-25 37 structure of atom around the nucleus. If the electrons were   stationary, electrostatic attraction between   the dense nucleus and the electrons would  pull the electrons toward the nucleus to form a miniature version of Thomson’s model of atom. Another serious drawback of the  Rutherford model is that it says nothing about  distribution of the electrons around the nucleus and the energies of these electrons. 2.3  Develo Pments leaDing to t He  boHr’s moDel of atom Histori cally, results observed from the studies  of interactions of radiations with matter have  provided immense information regarding the structure of atoms and molecules. Neils Bohr utilised these results to improve upon the model proposed by Rutherford. Two developments played a major role in the formulation of Bohr’s model of atom. These were: (i)  Dual  character  of the electromagneti c  radiation which means that radiations  possess both wave like and particle like properties, and--- --- \n",

However, Bohr’s model was  too simple to account for the following points. i)  It fails to account for the finer details  (doublet, that is two closely spaced lines)  of the hydrogen atom spectrum observed by using sop histicated spectroscopic  techniques. This model is also unable to explain the spectrum of atoms other than hydrogen, for example, helium atom which possesses only two electrons. Further, Bohr’s theory was also unable to explain the splitting of spectral lines in the presence of magnetic field (Zeeman effect) or an electric  field (Stark effect). ii) It could not explain the ability of atoms to form molecules by chemical bonds. In other words, taking into account the  points mentioned above, one needs a better theory which can explain the salient features  of the structure of complex atoms. 2.5  toWarDs QUantUm mecHanical  moDel of t He atom In view of the shortcoming of the Bohr’s  model, attempts were made to develop a more suitable and general model for atoms. Two important developments which contributed signi ficantly in the formulation  of such a  model were: 1.  Dual behaviour  of matter,  2.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.--- --- \n",

If the speed can be measured within accuracy of 2%, calculate the uncertainty in the position. solution The uncertainty in the speed is 2%, i.e.,  Using the equation (2.22) = 1.46×10–33 m This is nearly ~ 1018 times smaller  than the diameter of a typical atomic nucleus. As mentioned earlier for large particles, the uncertainty principle sets no meaningful limit to the precision of measurements. Reasons for the Failure of the Bohr Model One can now understand the reasons for the  failure of the Bohr model. In  Bohr model, an electron is regarded as a charged particle moving   in well defined circular orbits about  the nucleus. The wave character of the electron is not considered in  Bohr model. Further,  an orbit is a clearly defined path  and this path can compl etely be defined  only if both the position and the velocity of the electron are known exactly at the same time. This is not possible according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only ignores dual behaviour of matter but also contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

            " --- --- In view of these inherent weaknesses in the  Bohr model, there was no point in extending Bohr model to other atoms. In fact an insight into the structure of the atom was needed which could account for wave-particle duality of matter and be consistent with Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This came with the advent of quantum mechanics. 2.6   QUantUm mecHanical moDel of  atom Classic al mechanics, based on Newton’s  laws of motion, successfully describes the  motion of all macroscopic objects such as a falling stone, orbiting planets etc., which have essentially a particle-like behaviour as shown in the previous section. However it fails when applied to microscopic objects like electrons, atoms, molecules etc. This is mainly because of the fact that classical mechanics ignores the concept of dual behaviour of matter especially for sub-atomic particles and the uncertainty principle. The branch of science that takes into account  this dual behaviour of matter is called quantum mechanics .  Quantum mechanics is a theoretical  science that deals with the study of the motions of the microscopic objects that have both observable wave like and particle like properties.  It specifies the laws of motion that these objects  obey. When quantum mechanics  is applied to macroscopic objects (for which  wave like properties  are insignificant)  the  results are the same as those  from the  classical mechanics.  Quantum mechanics was developed  independently in 1926 by Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger. Here, however, we shall be discussing the quantum mechanics which is based on the ideas of wave motion. The fundamental equation of quantum mechanics was developed by Schrödinger  and it won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933. This equation which incorporates wave-particle duality of matter as proposed by de Broglie is quite complex and knowledge of higher mathematics  is needed to solve it. You will learn its solutions for different systems in higher classes.  For a system (such as an atom or a  molecule whose energy does not change with  time) the  schrödinger equati on is written  as  where  is a mathematical--- --- \n",
            " --- --- as  where  is a mathematical  operator called Hamiltonian. Schrödinger gave a recipe of constructing this operator from the expression for the total energy of the system. The total energy of the system takes into account the kinetic energies of all the sub-atomic particles (electrons, nuclei), attractive potential between the electrons and nuclei and repulsive potential among the electrons and nuclei individually. Solution of  this equation gives E and  ψ. Hydrogen Atom and the Schrödinger Equation When Schrödinger equation is solved for  hydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy levels the electron can occupy and the corresponding wave function(s) ( ψ) of  the electron associated with each energy level. These quantized energy states and corresponding wave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers (principal quantum number n, azimuthal quantum number l and  magnetic quantum number m l ) arise as a  natural consequence in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. When an electron  is in any energy state, the wave function Erwin Schrödinger, an  Austrian physicist received his Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of Vienna in 1910. In 1927 Schrödinger succeeded Max Planck at the  University of Berlin at Planck’s request. In 1933, Schrödinger left Berlin because of his opposition to Hitler and Nazi policies and returned to Austria in 1936. After the invasion of Austria by Germany, Schrödinger was forcibly removed from his professorship. He then moved to Dublin, Ireland where he remained for seventeen years. Schrödinger shared the Nobel Prize for Physics with P.A.M. Dirac in 1933.

The wave function is a mathematical function whose value depends upon the coordinates of the electron in the atom and does not carry any physical meaning. Such wave functions of hydrogen or hydrogen like species with one electron are called atomic orbitals. Such wave functions pertaining to one-electron species are called one-electron systems. The probability--- --- \n",
            " --- --- of finding an electron at a point  within an atom is proportional to the  |ψ|2 at  that point.  The quantum mechanical results of the hydrogen atom successfully predict all aspects of the hydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the Bohr model. Application of  Schrödinger equation to  multi-electron  atoms presents a difficulty:  the  Schrödinger equation cannot be solved exactly for  a multi-electron  atom. This difficulty can  be overcome by using approximate methods. Such calculat ions with the aid of modern  computers show that orbitals in atoms other than hydrogen do not differ in any radical way from the hydrogen orbitals discussed above. The principal difference lies in the consequence of increased nuclear charge. Because of this  all the orbitals are somewhat contracted. Further, as you shall see later (in subsections 2.6.3 and 2.6.4), unlike orbitals of hydrogen or hydrogen like species, whose energies depend only on the quantum number n, the energies of the orbitals in multi-electron  atoms depend on quantum numbers n and l. important features of the Quantum  mechanical model of atom Quantum mechanical model of atom is  the picture of the structure of the atom,  which emerges from the application of  the Schrödinger equation to atoms. The following are the important features of the  quantum-mechanical model of atom: 1.  The energy of electrons in atoms is   quantized (i.e., can only have certain  specific values), for example when electrons are bound to the nucleus in atoms.2. The existence of quantised electronic energy levels is a direct result of the wave like properties of electrons and are  allowed solutions of Schrödinger  wave equation. 3. Both the exact position and exact velocity of an electron in  an atom  cannot be determined simultaneously (Heisenberg uncertainty principle). The path of an electron in an atom  therefore, can never be determined or known accurately. That is why, as you shall see later on, one talks of only probability of finding  the electron at different points in   an atom.--- --- \n",
            " --- --- with electrons embedded into it. This model in which mass of the atom is considered to be evenly spread over the atom was proved wrong by Rutherford’s famous alpha-particle scattering experiment in 1909. Rutherford concluded that atom is made of a tiny positively charged nucleus , at its centre with electrons revolving around it in circular orbits .  rutherford model, which resembles the solar  system, was no doubt an improvement over  thomson model but it could not account for the stability of the atom i.e. , why the electron  does not fall into the nucleus. Further, it was also silent about the electronic structure of atoms i.e., about the distribution and relative energies of electrons around the nucleus. The difficulties  of the Rutherford  model were overcome  by Niels Bohr in 1913 in his model of the  hydrogen atom. Bohr postulated that electron moves around the nucleus in  circular orbits.  Only certain orbits can exist and each orbit corresponds  to a specific energy. Bohr calculated   the energy of electron in various orbits and for each orbit predicted the distance between the electron and nucleus.  bohr model, though offering a satisfactory model for explaining the  spectra of the hydrogen atom, could not explain the spectra of multi-electron  atoms. The  reason for this was soon discovered. In Bohr model, an electron is regarded as a charged particle  moving in a well defined circular orbit about the nucleus. The wave character  of  the electron is ignored in Bohr’s theory. An orbit is a clearly defined path and this path can  completely  be defined only if both the exact position and the exact velocity of the electron  at the same time are known.  This is not possible according to the Heisenberg uncertainty--- --- \n",
            " --- --- principle. Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only ignores the dual behaviour of electron but also contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle .  Erwin Schrödinger, in 1926, proposed an equation called Schrödinger equation to  describe the electron distributions in space and the allowed energy levels in atoms. This equation incorporates de Broglie’s concept of wave-particle duality and is consistent with  Heisenberg uncertainty principle. When Schrödinger equation is solved for the electron in a hydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy states the electron can occupy [and the corresponding wave function(s) ( ψ) (which in fact are the mathematical functions) of the  electron associated with each energy state]. These quantized energy states and corresponding wave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers ( principal  quantum number n, azimuthal quantum number l and magnetic quantum number m l)  arise as a natural consequence in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. The restrictions on the values of these three quantum numbers also come naturally from this solution. The quantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom successfully predicts all aspects of the hydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the Bohr model. According to the quantum mechanical model of the atom, the electron distribution of an  atom containing a number of electrons is divided into shells. The shells, in turn, are thought  to consist of one or more subshells and subshells are assumed to be composed of one or more orbitals, which the electrons occupy. While for hydrogen and hydrogen like systems (such as He +, Li2+ etc.) all the orbitals within a given shell have same energy, the energy of  the orbitals in a multi-electron atom depends upon the values of n and l: The lower the value  of (n + l ) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same (n + l ) value,  the orbital with lower value of n has the lower energy. In an atom many such orbitals are  Unit 2.indd   68 9/9/2022   4:28:23 PM 2024-25\n",
            "The existence of atoms has been proposed since the time of early Indian and Greek philosophers (400 B.C.)

However, it failed to explain the results of many experiments, for example, it was known that substances like glass or ebonite when rubbed with silk or fur get electrically charged. In this unit we start with the experimental observations  made by scientists towards the end of nineteenth and beginning of twentieth century. These established that atoms are made of sub-atomic particles, i.e., electrons,  protons and neutrons — a concept very different from that  of Dalton. objectives Unit 2.indd   29 9/9/2022   4:28:07 PM 2024-25 30 chemistry 2.1 Discovery of sUb-atomic  Particles An insight into the structure of atom was  obtained from the experiments on electrical discharge  through gases. Before we discuss  these results we need to keep in mind a basic rule regarding the behaviour of charged particles : “Like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other”.  2.1.1 Discovery of  electron  In 1830, Michael F araday showed that if  electricity is passed through a solution of an  electrolyte, chemical reactions occurred at the electrodes, which resulted in the liberation and deposition of matter at the electrodes. He formulated certain laws which you will study in Class XII. These results suggested the particulate nature of electricity. In mid 1850s many scientists mainly  Faraday began to study electrical discharge  in partially evacuated tubes, known as cathode ray discharge tubes. It is depicted in Fig. 2.1. A cathode ray tube is made of glass containing two thin pieces of metal, called electrodes, sealed in it. The electrical discharge through the gases could be observed only at very low pressures and at very high voltages. The pressure of different gases could be adjusted by evacuation of the glass  tubes. When sufficiently  high voltage  is applied across the electrodes, current starts  flowing through a stream of particles  moving in the tube from the negative electrode (cathode) to  the positive electrode  (anode). These were called cathode rays or cathode ray particles.  The flow of current--- --- \n",
            " --- --- The flow of current  from cathode to anode was further checked by making a hole in the anode and coating the tube behind anode with phosphorescent material zinc sulphide. When these  rays,  after passing through anode, strike the zinc sulphide coating, a bright spot is developed on the coating [Fig. 2.1(b)].  Fig. 2.1(a) A cathode ray discharge tube Fig. 2.1(b)  A cathode ray discharge tube wi th  perforated anode The results of these experiments are  summarised below. (i) The catho de rays start from cathode and  move towards the anode. (ii) These rays themselves are not visible but their behaviour can be observed with the help of certain kind of materials (fluorescent  or phosphorescent)  which  glow when hit by them. Television picture tubes are cathode ray tubes and television pictures resul t due to  fluorescence  on the television  screen  coated with certain fluorescent or phosphorescent materials. (iii)  In the absence of electrical or magnetic field,  these rays travel in straight lines  (Fig. 2.2). (iv) In the presence of electrical or magnetic field,  the behaviour  of cathode rays are  similar to that expected from negatively charged particles, suggesting that the cathode rays consist of n egatively  charged particles, called electrons. (v) The characteristics of cathode rays (electrons) do not depend upon the  Unit 2.indd   30 9/9/2022   4:28:08 PM 2024-25 31 structure of atom material of electrodes and the nature of  the gas present in the cathode ray tube.  Thus, we can conclude that electrons are basic constituent of all the atoms. 2.1.2  charge to mass ratio of electron In 1897, British physicist  J.J. Thomson   measured the ratio of electrical charge (e) to  the mass of electron (me ) by using cathode  ray tube and applying electrical and magnetic field--- --- \n",
            " --- --- ray tube and applying electrical and magnetic field  perpendicular  to each other as well as  to the path of electrons (Fig. 2.2). When only electric  field is applied, the electrons deviate  from their path and hit the cathode ray tube at point A (Fig. 2.2). Similarly when only magnetic  field is applied, electron strikes  the cathode ray tube at point C. By carefully balancing  the electrical and magnetic field  strength, it is possible to bring back the electron to the path which is followed in the absence  of electric or magnetic field and they  hit the screen at point B. Thomson argued that the amount of deviation of the particles from  their path in the presence of electrical  or magnetic field depends upon: (i) the magnitude of the negative charge on  the particle, greater the magnitude of the charge on the particle, greater is the interaction with  the electric or magnetic  field and thus greater is the deflection. (ii) the mass of the particle — lighter the  particle, greater the deflection.(iii) the str ength of the electrical or magnetic  field — the deflection  of electrons from its  original path increases with the increase  in the voltage across the electrodes, or the  strength of the magnetic field. By carrying out accurate measurements  on the amount of deflections  observed by  the electrons on the electric field strength or  magnetic field strength, Thomson  was able to  determine the value of  e/me as:  = 1.758820 × 1011 C kg–1                  (2.1) Where me is the mass of the electron in kg  and e is the magnitude of the charge on the  electron in coulomb (C). Since electrons are--- --- \n",

Millikan (1868-1953) devised a method  known as oil drop experiment (1906-14),   to determine the charge on the electrons. He found the charge on the electron to be   – 1.6 × 10 –19 C. The present accepted value of  electrical charge is – 1.602176 × 10–19 C. The  mass of the  electron (me) was determined by  combining these results with Thomson’s value of e/m e ratio. = 9.1094×10–31 kg                             (2.2) Fig. 2.2  The apparatus to determine the charge to the mass ratio of electron Unit 2.indd   31 9/9/2022   4:28:08 PM 2024-25 32 chemistry 2.1.4 Discovery of Protons and neutrons Electrical discharge  carried out in the modified  cathode ray tube led to the discovery of canal  rays carrying positively charged particles. The cha racteristics of these positively charged  particles are listed below. (i) Unlike cathode rays, mass of positively  charged particles depends upon the nature of gas present in the cathode ray tube. T hese are simply the positively  charged gaseous ions.  (ii) The charge to mass  ratio of the particles  depends on the gas from which these originate. (iii)  Some of the positively charged particles carry a multiple of the fundamental unit of electrical charge. (iv)  The behaviour of these particles in the magnetic  or electrical field is opposite  to that observed for electron or cathode rays. The smallest and lightest positive ion  was obtained from hydrogen and was called proton. This positively charged particle  was--- --- \n",
            " --- --- was   characterised in 1919. Later, a need was felt for the presence of electrically neutral particle as one of the constituent of atom. These particles were discovered by Chadwick (1932) by bombarding a thin sheet of beryllium by α-particles. When electrically neutral  particles having a mass slightly greater than that of protons were emitted. He named these particles as neutrons . The important  properties of all these fundamental particles are given in Table 2.1. 2.2  atomic moDels Observations obtained from the experiments  mentioned in the  previous sections have  suggested  that Dalton’s indivisible  atom is  composed of sub-atomic particl es carrying  positive and negative charges. The major  problems before the scientists after the discovery of sub-atomic particles were:   to account for the stability of atom,   to compare the behaviour of elements  in terms of both physical and chemical properties,millikan’s oil Drop method In this method, oil droplets in the form of  mist, produced by the atomiser, were allowed to enter through a tiny hole in the upper plate of electrical condenser. The downward motion of these droplets was viewed through the telescope, equipped with a micrometer eye piece. By measuring the rate of fall of these droplets, Millikan was able to measure the mass of oil droplets. The air inside the chamber was ionized by passing a beam of  X-rays through it. The electrical charge on these oil droplets was acquired by collisions with gaseous ions. The fall of these charged oil droplets can be retarded, accelerated or made stationary depending upon the charge on the droplets and the polarity and strength of the voltage applied to the plate. By carefully measuring the effects of electrical field  strength on the motion of oil droplets,  Millikan concluded that the magnitude of electrical charge, q, on  the droplets is always  an integral multiple of the electrical charge, e, that is, q = n e, where n = 1, 2, 3... .   to explain the formation of different  kinds of molecules by the combination of different atoms and,--- --- \n",

In chamber, the forces acting on oil drop are:    gravitational, electrostatic due to electrical field and a viscous drag force when the oil drop is moving. Unit 2.indd   32 9/9/2022   4:28:08 PM 2024-25 33 structure of atom Different atomic models were proposed   to explain the distributions of these charged  particles in an atom. Although some of these models were not able to explain the stability of atoms,  two of these models, one proposed  by J.J. Thomson  and the other proposed by  Ernest Rutherford are discussed below. 2.2.1 thomson model of atom J. J. Thomson,  in 1898, proposed that an  atom possesses a  spherical shape (radius  approximately 10–10 m) in which the positive  charge is uniformly distributed. The electrons  are embedded into it in such a manner as to give the most stable electrostatic arrangement (Fig. 2.4). Many different names are given to this model, for example, plum pudding, raisin pudding or watermelon. This model In the later half of the nineteenth century  different kinds of rays were discovered, besides those mentioned earlier. Wilhalm Röentgen (1845-1923) in 1895 showed that when electrons strike a material in the cathode ray tubes, produce rays which can  cause fluorescence  in the fluorescent   materials placed outside the cathode ray tubes. Since Röentgen did not know the nature of the radiation, he named them X-rays and the name is still carried on. It was noticed that X-rays are produced effectively when electrons strike the dense metal anode,   called targets. These are not deflected by the  electric and magnetic fields and have a very  high penetrating power through the matter and that is the reason that these rays  are--- --- \n",
            " --- --- are  used to study the interior of the objects. These rays are of very short wavelengths (∼0.1 nm) and possess electro-magnetic  character (Section 2.3.1). Henri Becqueral (1852-1908) observed  that there are certain elements which emit radiation on their own and named this phenomenon as  radioactivity and the  elements known as radioactive elements. This  field was developed  by Marie Curie,  Piere Curie, Rutherford and Fredrick Soddy. It was observed that three kinds of rays i.e., α, β- and  γ-rays are emitted. Rutherford  found that α -rays consists of high energy  particles carrying two units of positive charge and four unit of atomic mass. He concluded that α- particles are helium nuclei as when α -  particles combined with two electrons yielded helium gas. β-rays are negatively charged Fig.2.4 Thomson model of atom can be visualised as a pudding or watermelon  of positive charge with plums or seeds (electrons) embedded into it. An important feature of this model is that the mass of the atom is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the atom. Although this model was able to explain the overall neutrality of the atom, but was not consistent with the results of later experiments. Thomson was awarded Nobel Prize for physics in 1906, for his theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases.table 2.1  Properties of fundamental Particles  name symbol absolute  charge/ crelative  chargemass/kg mass/u approx.  mass/u Electron ProtonNeutrone p n– 1.602176×10 –19 + 1.602176×10–19 0–1 +1 09.109382×10–31 1.6726216×10–27 1.674927×10–270.000541.007271.00867011 Unit 2.indd   33 9/9/2022   4:28:08 PM 2024-25 34 chemistry represented in Fig. 2.5. A stream of high  energy α–particles from a radioactive source--- --- \n",
            " --- --- was directed at a thin foil (thickness ∼  100 nm)  of gold metal. The thin gold foil had a circular fluorescent  zinc sulphide screen around it.  Whenever α–particles struck the screen, a  tiny flash of light was produced  at that point. The results of scattering experiment were  quite unexpected. According  to Thomson  model of atom, the mass of each gold atom  in the foil should have been spread evenly over the entire atom, and α –particles had  enough energy to pass directly through such a uniform distribution of mass. It was expected that the particles would slow down and change directions only by a small angles as they passed through the foil. It was observed that: (i)  most of the α–particles passed through the  gold foil undeflected. (ii) a small fraction of the α–particles was deflected  by small angles. (iii) a very few α –particles (∼ 1 in 20,000)  bounced back, that is, were deflected by  nearly 180°.  On the basis of the observations,  Rutherford drew the following conclusions regarding the structure of atom: (i)  Most of the space in  the atom is empty as  most of the α–particles passed through  the foil undeflected. (ii) A few posit ively charged α–particles were  deflected.  The deflection  must be due  to enormous repulsive force showing that the positive charge of the atom is not spread  throughout the atom as  Thomson had presumed. The positive charge has to be concentrated in a very small  volume that repelled and deflected  the positively charged α–particles.  (iii) Calculations by Rutherford showed that the vol ume occupied by the nucleus  is negligibly small as compared to the total volume of the atom. The radius of the atom is about 10 –10 m, while that of  nucleus is 10–15 m. One can appreciate--- --- \n",
            " --- --- this difference in size by realising that if Fig. 2.5  Schematic view of Rutherford’ s  scattering experiment.

Schematic molecular view of the gold foil2.2.2  rutherford’s nuclear model of atom Rutherford and his students (Hans Geiger   and Ernest Marsden) bombarded very thin gold foil with α –particles. Rutherford’s famous   –particle scattering experiment is particles similar to electrons. The γ-rays  are high energy radiations like X-rays, are  neutral in nature and do not consist of particles. As regards penetrating power, α-particles are the least, followed by β-rays (100 times that of α–particles) and γ-rays  (1000 times of that α-particles).

On the basis of above observations and  conclusions, Rutherford proposed the nuclear  model of atom. According to this model: (i) The positive charge and most of the mass  of the atom was densely concentrated in extremely small region. This very small portion  of the atom was called nucleus  by Rutherford.  (ii)  The nucleus is surrounded by electrons that move around the nucleus with a very high speed in circular paths called orbits. Thus,  Rutherford’s model of atom  resembles the solar system in which the nucleus plays the role of sun and the electrons that of revolving planets. (iii)   Electrons and the nucleu s are held  together by electrostatic forces of  attraction. 2.2.3  atomic number and mass number The pres ence of positive charge on the nucleus  is due to the protons in the nucleus.

            "established earlier, the charge on the proton is equal but opposite to that of electron. The number of protons present in the nucleus is equal to atomic number (Z ). For example, the  number of protons in the hydrogen nucleus is 1, in sodium atom it is 11, therefore their atomic numbers are 1 and 11 respectively. In order to keep the electrical neutrality,  the number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protons (atomic number, Z  ). For exam ple, number of electrons in  hydrogen atom and sodium atom are 1 and 11 respectively. atomic number (Z ) = number of  protons in               the nucleus of an atom       =  number of electrons           in a nuetral atom   (2.3) While the positive charge of the nucleus  is due to protons, the mass  of the nucleus,   due to protons and neutrons. As discussed  earlier protons and neutrons present in the nucleus are collectively known as nucleons . The total number of nucleons is termed as  mass number ( a) of the atom.  mass number ( a) = number of protons (Z )                          + number of             neutrons (n)           (2.4) 2.2.4 isobars and isotopes The composition of any atom can be  represented by using the normal element symbol (X) with super-script on the left hand side as the atomic mass number (A) and subscript (Z ) on the left hand side as the   atomic number (i.e., A Z X). Isobars are the atoms with same mass  number but different atomic number for  example, 614C and 714N. On the other hand,  atoms with identical atomic number but different atomic mass number are known as  isotopes. In  other words (according to--- --- \n",
            " --- --- other words (according to  equation 2.4), it is evident that difference between the isotopes is due to the presence of different number of neutrons present in the nucleus. For example, considering of hydrogen atom again, 99.985% of hydrogen atoms contain only one proton. This isotope is called protium ( 11H). Rest of the percentage of  hydrogen atom contains two other isotopes, the one containing 1 proton and 1 neutron is called deuterium ( 12D, 0.015%) and the  other one possessing 1 proton and 2 neutrons is called tritium ( 13t ). The latter isotope is  found in trace amounts on the earth. Other examples of commonly occuring isotopes are: carbon atoms containing 6, 7 and 8 neutrons besides 6 protons ( 612 613 614C, C, C); chlorine  atoms containing 18 and 20 neutrons besides 17 protons ( 1735 1737Cl,C l). Lastly an important point to mention  regarding isotopes is that chemical properties  of atoms are controlled by the number of electrons, which are determined by the number of protons in the nucleus. Number of neutrons present in the nucleus have very little effect on the chemical properties of an element. Therefore, all the isotopes of a given element show same chemical behaviour.

If the species is an ion, determine whether the number of protons are larger (cation, positive ion) or smaller (anion, negative ion) than the number of electrons. Number of neutrons is always given by A–Z, whether the species is neutral or ion. 2.2.5 Drawbacks of  rutherford model As you have learnt above, Rutherford nuclear  model of an atom is like a small scale solar system with the nucleus  playing the role  * Classical mechanics is a theoretical science based on Newton’s laws of motion. It specifies the laws of motion of macroscopic objects.of the massive sun and the electrons being  similar to the lighter planets. When classical mechanics* is applied to the solar system, it shows  that the planets describe well-defined   orbits around t he sun. The gravitational force  between the planets is given by the expression  G.12 2mm r/unif0e6 /unif0e8/unif0e7/unif0f6 /unif0f8/unif0f7 where m1 and m2 are the masses,  r is the distance of separation of the masses  and G is the gravitational constant. The theory can also calculate precisely the planetary orbits and these are in agreement with the experimental measurements. The similarity between the solar system  and nuclear model suggests that electrons should move around the nucleus in well defined  orbits. Further, the coulomb force  (kq1q2/r2 where q1 and q2 are the charges, r--- --- \n",
            " --- --- atom, depends not only on its principal quantum number (shell), but also on its azimuthal quantum number (subshell). That is, for a given principal quantum number, s,   p, d, f ... all have different energies. Within  a given principal quantum number, the energy of orbitals increases in the order s<p<d<f. For higher energy levels, these  differences  are sufficiently  pronounced  and  straggering of orbital  energy may result,  e.g., 4s <3d and 6s <5d; 4f<6p. The main  reason for having different energies of the subshells is the mutual repulsion among the electrons in multi-electron atoms. The only electrical interaction present in hydrogen atom is the attraction between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged  nucleus. In multi-electron atoms, besides the presence of attraction between the electron and nucleus, there are repulsion terms between every electron and other electrons present in the atom. Thus the stability of an electron in a multi-electron atom is because total attractive interactions are more than the repulsive interactions. In general, the repulsive interaction of the electrons in the outer shell with the electrons in the inner shell are more important. On the other hand, the attractive interactions of an electron increases with increase of positive charge (Ze) on the nucleus.  Due to the presence of electrons in  the inner shells, the electron in the outer shell will not experience the full positive charge of the nucleus ( Ze). The effect will be lowered  due to the partial screening of positive charge on the nucleus by the inner shell electrons. This is known as the shielding of the outer  shell electrons from the nucleus  by the inner shell electrons, and the net positive charge experienced by the outer electrons is known as effective nuclear charge (Z eff e).  Despite the shielding of the outer electrons  from the nucleus by the inner shell electrons, the attractive force experienced by the outer shell electrons increases with increase of nuclear charge.

            "(ii)  Experimental results regarding atomic spectra. First, we will discuss about the  duel nature  of electromagnetic radiations. Experimental results regarding atomic spectra will be discussed in Section 2.4. 2.3.1  Wave nature of electromagnetic    r adiation In the mid-nineteenth century, physicists  actively studied absorption and emission  of  radiation by heated objects. These are called thermal  radiations.  They tried to find out of  what the thermal radiation is made. It is now a well-known  fact that thermal radiations  consist of electromagnetic waves of various frequencies or wavelengths. It is based on a number of modern concepts, which were unknown in the mid-nineteenth century. First active study of thermal radiation laws occured in the 1850’s and the theory of electromagnetic waves and the emission of such waves by accelerating charged particles was  developed  in the early 1870’s by James  Clerk Maxwell, which was experimentally  confirmed  later by Heinrich Hertz. Here, we  will learn some facts about electromagnetic radiations. James  Maxwell (1870) was the first to  give a comprehensive explanation about the  interaction between the charged bodies and the behavio ur of electrical and magnetic  fields on macroscopic  level. He suggested   that when electrically charged particle moves under accelaration, alternating electrical and magnet ic fields are produced and transmitted.   These fields are transmitted  in the forms  of waves called electromagnetic waves or electromagnetic radiation. Light is the form of radiation known from  early  days and speculation about its nature  dates back to remote ancient times. In earlier days (Newton) light was supposed to be made of particles (corpuscules). It was only in the 19th century when wave nature of light was established. Maxwell  was again the first to reveal that  light waves  are associated with oscillating  electric and magnetic character (Fig. 2.6).  Although electromagnetic wave motion is--- --- \n",

With this theory, Planck was able to explain  the distribution of intensity in the radiation  from black body as a function of frequency or wavelength at different temperatures.  Quantisati on has been compared to  standing on a staircase. A person can stand  on any step of a staircase, but it is not possible for him/her to stand in between the two steps. The energy can take any one of the values from the following set, but cannot take on any  values between them. E = 0, hυ, 2hυ , 3hυ.... nhυ..... Photoelectric Effect In 1887, H. Hertz performed a very interesting  experiment in which electrons (or electric current) were ejected when certain metals (for example potassium, rubidium, caesium etc.) were exposed to a beam of light as shown   in Fig.  2.9. The phenomenon is called  Photoelectric effect. The results observed  in this experiment were:  (i) The electrons are ejected from the metal  surface as soon as the beam of light strikes the surface, i.e., there is no time lag between the striking of light beam and the ejection of electrons from the metal surface. ( ii) The number of electrons ejected is proportional to the intensity or brightness of light.  (iii)  For each metal, there is a characteristic minimum frequency,  ν0 (also known  as threshold frequency ) below which  photoelectric effect is not observed. At a frequency ν >ν 0, the ejected electrons  come out with certain kinetic energy. The kinetic energies of these electrons increase with the increase of frequency of the light used. All the above results could not be explained  on the basis of laws of classical physics. According to latter, the energy content of the beam of light depends upon the brightness of the light. In other words, number of electrons ejected and kinetic energy associated with them should depend on the brightness of light. It has been observed that though the number  Fig.2.9  Equipment for studying the photoelectric   effect. Light of a particular frequency--- --- \n",

Electrons are ejected from the metal and are counted by a detector that measures their kinetic energy.Max Planck (1858–1947) Max Planck, a German physicist, received his Ph.D in theoretical physics from the University of Munich in 1879. In 1888, he was appointed Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Berlin.  Planck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918 for his quantum theory. Planck also made significant contributions in thermodynamics and other areas of physics. Unit 2.indd   41 9/9/2022   4:28:11 PM 2024-25 42 chemistry of electrons ejected does depend upon the  brightness of light, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons does not. For example, red light [ν = (4.3 to 4.6) × 10 14 Hz] of any brightness  (intensity) may shine on a piece of potassium metal for hours but no photoelectrons are ejected. But, as soon as even a very weak yellow light (ν = 5.1–5.2 × 10 14 Hz) shines on  the potassium metal, the photoelectric effect is observed. The threshold frequency (ν 0) for  potassium metal is 5.0×1014 Hz.  Einstein (1905) was able to explain the  photoelectric effect using Planck’s quantum theory of electromagnetic radiation as a starting point. the minimum energy required to eject the  electron is h ν 0 (also called work function,  W0; Table 2.2), then the difference in energy   (hν – hν0 ) is transferred as the kinetic energy of  the photoelectron. Following the conservation of energy principle, the kinetic energy of the ejected electron is given by the equation 2.7.   (2.7) where me is the mass of the electron and v  is the  velocity associated with the ejected electron. Lastly, a more intense beam of light consists of larger number of photons, consequently the number of electrons ejected is also larger as compared to that in an experiment in which a beam of weaker intensity of light is employed.  Dual Behaviour of Electromagnetic  Radiation--- --- \n",
            " --- --- Radiation The particle nature of light posed a dilemma for  scientists. On the one hand, it could explain the black body radiation and  photoelectric effect satisfactorily but on the other hand, it was not consistent with the known wave behaviour of light which could account for the phenomena of interference and diffraction. The only way to resolve the dilemma was to accept the idea that light possesses both particle and wave-like properties, i.e., light  has dual behaviour.  Depending  on  the experiment,  we find that light behaves  either as a wave or as a stream of particles.  Whenever radiation interacts with matter,  it  displays particle like properties in contrast to the wavelike properties (interference and diffraction), which it exhibits when it propagates. This concept was totally alien to the way the scientists thought about matter and radiation and it took them a long time to become convinced of its validity. It turns out, as you shall see later, that some microscopic  particles like electrons also exhibit this wave-particle duality.Shining a beam of light on to a metal  surface can, therefore, be viewed as shooting  a beam of particles, the photons. When a photon  of sufficient energy strikes an electron  in the atom  of the metal, it transfers its energy  instantaneously to the electron during the collision and the electron is ejected without any time lag or delay. Greater the energy possessed by the photon, greater will be transfer of energy to the electron and greater the kinetic energy of the ejected electron. In other words, kinetic energy of the ejected electron is proportional to the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation.

(iii)  It is now well established that there are many types of  electromagnetic  radiations, which differ from one another in wavelength (or frequency). These constitute what is called electromagnetic spectrum (Fig. 2.7). Different  regions of the spectrum  are  identified  by different names. Some  examples are: radio frequency region around 10 6 Hz, used for broadcasting;  microwave region around 1010 Hz used  for radar; infrared region around 1013  Hz used for heating; ultraviolet region around 10 16Hz a component of sun’s  radiation.

Special instruments are required to detect non-visible radiation.(iv)    Differ ent kinds of units are used to  represent electromagnetic radiation.

It radiates same amount of energy per unit area as it absorbs from its surrounding in any given time. The amount of light emitted (intensity of radiation) from a black body and its spectral distribution depends only on its temperature. At a given temperature, intensity of radiation emitted increases with the increase of wavelength, reaches a maximum value at a given wavelength and then starts decreasing with further increase of wavelength, as shown in Fig. 2.8. Also, as the temperature increases, maxima of the curve shifts to short wavelength. Several attempts were made to predict the intensity of radiation  as a function of wavelength. But the results of the above experiment  could not be explained satisfactorily on  the basis of the wave theory of light. Max Planck arrived at a satisfactory relationship   Fig. 2.8(a)  Black body Fig. 2.8  Wavelength-intensity relationship(iv) Line spectra of atoms with special reference to hydrogen. These phenomena indicate that the system  can take energy onl y in discrete amounts.  All possible energies cannot be taken up or  radiated.  It is noteworthy  that the first concrete  explanation for the phenomenon of the black  body radiation mentioned above was given by  Max Planck in 1900. Let us first try to  understand t his phenomenon, which is  given  below: Hot objects emit electromagnetic  radiations over a wide range of wavelengths. At high temperatures, an appreciable proportion of radiation is in the visible region of the spectrum. As the temperature is raised, a higher proportion of short wavelength (blue light) is generated. For example, when an iron rod is heated in a furnace,  it first turns to dull red and then  progressively becomes more and  more red  as the temperature increases. As this is heated further, the radiation emitted becomes--- --- \n",
            " --- --- white and then becomes blue as the temperature becomes very high. This means that red radiation is most intense at a particular temperature and the blue radiation is more intense at another temperature. This means intensities of radiations of different wavelengths emitted by hot body depend upon its temperature. By late 1850’s it was known that objects made of different material and kept at different temperatures emit different amount of radiation. Also, when the surface of an object is irradiated with light (electromagnetic radiation), a part of radiant energy  is generally reflected as such, a part  is absorbed and a part of it is transmitted. The reason for incomplete absorption is that ordinary objects are as a rule imperfect absorbers of radiation. An ideal body, which emi ts and absorbs radiations of all frequencies  uniformly, is called a black body and the radiation emitted by such a body is called black body radiation. In practice, no such body exists. Carbon black approximates fairly closely to black body. A good physical  approximation to a black body is a cavity with a tiny hole, which has no other opening.

Their frequency of oscillation is changed by interaction with oscilators of electromagnetic radiation. Planck assumed that radiation could be sub-divided into discrete chunks of energy. He suggested that atoms and molecules could emit or absorb energy only in discrete quantities and not in a continuous manner. He gave the name quantum  to the smallest quantity of energy  that can be emitted or absorbed in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The energy (E) of a quantum of radiation is proportional   to its frequency (ν ) and is expressed by  equation (2.6).

This fact has been put to use in making an electron microscope, which is based on the wavelike behaviour of electrons just as an ordinary microscope utilises the wave nature of light. An electron microscope is a powerful tool  in modern scientific research because it  achieves a magnification  of about 15 million  times. It needs to be noted that according to de  Broglie, every object in motion has a wave character. The wavelengths associated with ordinary objects are so short (because of their large masses) that their  wave properties cannot  be detected. The wavelengths associated with electrons and other subatomic particles (with very small mass) can however be detected experimentally. Results obtained from the following problems prove these points qualitatively.

If the position of  the electron is known with high degree of accuracy (∆x is small), then the velocity of the electron will be uncertain [∆(v x) is large]. On  the other hand, if the velocity of the electron is known precisely (∆(v x ) is small), then the  position of the electron will be uncertain   (∆x will be large). Thus, if we carry out some physical measurements on the electron’s position or velocity, the outcome will always depict a fuzzy or blur picture. The uncertainty principle can be best  understood with the help of an example.--- --- \n",
            " --- --- Suppose you are asked to measure the thickness of a sheet of paper with an unmarked metrestick. Obviously, the results obtained would be extremely inaccurate and meaningless. In order to obtain any accuracy, you should use an instrument graduated in units smaller than the thickness of a sheet of the paper. Analogously, in order to determine the position of an electron, we must use a meterstick calibrated in units of smaller than the dimensions of electron (keep in mind that an electron is considered as a point charge and is therefore, dimensionless). To observe an electron, we can illuminate it with “light” or electromagnetic radiation. The “light” used must have a wavelength smaller than the dimensions of an electron. The high  momentum photons of such light  ph=/unif06c/unif0e6 /unif0e8/unif0e7/unif0f6 /unif0f8/unif0f7   would change the energy of electrons by  collisions. In this process we, no doubt, would be able to calculate the position of the electron, but we would know very little about the velocity of the electron after the collision. Significance of Uncertainty Principle One of the important implications of the  Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is that it rules out existence of definite paths or trajectories of electrons and other similar particles. The trajectory of an object is determined by its location and velocity at various moments. If we know where a body is at a particular instant and if we also know its velocity and the forces acting on it at that instant, we can tell where the body would be sometime later. We, therefore, conclude that the position of an object and its velocity fix its trajectory. Since for a sub-atomic object such as an electron, it is not possible simultaneously to determine the position and velocity at any given instant to an arbitrary degree of precision, it is not possible to talk of the trajectory of an electron. the effect of H eisenberg Uncertainty  Principle is significant only for motion of microscopic objects and is negligible for that of macroscopic objects. This can be seen from the following examples. If uncertainty principle is applied to an  object of mass, say about a milligram (10 –6 kg),  then--- --- \n",

During World War II, Heisenberg was in charge of German research on the atomic bomb. After the war he was named director of Max Planck Institute for physics in Gottingen. He was also accomplished mountain climber. Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932.

As a  result, the beam of light is deviated or refracted from its original path as it passes from one medium to another. It is observed that when a ray of white light is passed through a prism, the wave with shorter wavelength bends more than the one with a longer wavelength. Since ordinary white light consists of waves with all the wavelengths in the visible range, a ray of white light is spread out into a series of coloured bands called spectrum. The light of red colour which has longest wavelength is deviated the least while the violet light, which has shortest wavelength is deviated the most. The spectrum of white light, that we can see, ranges from violet at 7.50 ×  10 14 Hz to  red at 4× 1014 Hz. Such a spectrum is called  continuous spectrum. Continuous because violet merges into blue, blue into green and so on. A similar spectrum is produced when a rainbow forms in the sky. Remember that visible light is just a small portion of the electromagnetic radiation (Fig.2.7). When electromagnetic radiation interacts with matter, atoms and molecules may absorb energy and reach to a higher energy state. With higher energy, these are in an unstable state. For returning to their normal (more stable, lower energy states) energy state, the atoms and molecules emit radiations in various  regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Emission and Absorption Spectra The spectrum of radiation emitted by a substance that has absorbed energy is called an emission spectrum. Atoms, molecules or  ions that have absorbed radiation are said to be “excited” . To produce an emission  spectrum, energy is supplied to a sample by heating it or irradiating it and the wavelength (or frequency) of the radiation emitted, as the sample gives up the absorbed energy, is recorded. An absorption spectrum is like the--- --- \n",
            " --- --- An absorption spectrum is like the  photographic negative of an emission spectrum. A continuum of radiation is passed  through a sample which absorbs radiation of certain wavelengths. The missing wavelength which corresponds to the radiation absorbed by the matter, leave dark spaces in the bright continuous spectrum. The study of emission or absorption  spectra is referred to as spectroscopy. The  spectrum of the visible light, as discussed above, was continuous as all wavelengths (red to violet) of the visible light are represented in the spectra. The emission spectra of atoms in the gas phase, on the other hand, do not show a continuous spread of wavelength from red to  violet, rather they emit light only at specific  wavelengths with dark spaces between them. Such spectra  are called line spectra or  atomic spectra because the emitted radiation is  identified  by the appearance  of bright lines  in the spectra (Fig. 2.10 page 45). line emission spectra are of great  interest in the study of electronic structure. Each element has a unique line emission spectrum. The characteristic lines in atomic spectra can be used in chemical analysis to identify unknown atoms in the same way as  fingerprints  are used to identify people.  The exact matching of lines of the emission spectrum of the atoms of a known element with the  lines from an unknown sample  quickly establishes the identity of the latter, German chemist, Robert Bunsen (1811-1899) was  one of the first investigators  to use line  spectra to identify elements. Elements like rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs)  thallium (Tl), indium (In), gallium (Ga) and scandium (Sc) were discovered when their minerals were analysed by spectroscopic me thods. The element helium (He) was  discovered in the sun by spectroscopic method. Line Spectrum of Hydrogen  When an electric discharge is passed through  gaseous hydrogen, the H2 molecules dissociate--- --- \n",
            " --- --- and the energetically excited hydrogen atoms produced emit electromagnetic radiation of discrete frequencies. The hydrogen spectrum consists of several series of lines named after their discoverers. Balmer showed in 1885 on the basis of experimental observations  * The restriction of any property to discrete values is called quantization. Unit 2.indd   44 9/9/2022   4:28:11 PM 2024-25 45 structure of atom that if spectral lines are expressed in terms  of wavenumber ( ), then the visible lines of  the hydrogen spectrum obey the following  formula:          (2.8) where n is an integer equal to or greater than  3 (i.e., n = 3,4,5,....) The series of lines described by this formula  are called the balmer series. The Balmer  seri es of lines are the only lines in the hydrogen  spectrum which appear in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Swedish spectroscopist,  Johannes  Rydberg,  noted  that all series of lines in the hydrogen spectrum could be described by the following   expression :          (2.9) where n1=1,2........ n2 = n1 + 1, n1 + 2......The value 109,677 cm–1 is called the  rydberg constant  for hydrogen.  The first five  series of lines that correspond to n1 = 1, 2, 3,  4, 5 are known as Lyman, Balmer, Paschen,  Bracket and Pfund series, respectively,   Table 2.3 shows these series of transitions in the hydrogen spectrum. Fig. 2.11 (page, 46) shows the Lyman, Balmer and Paschen series of transitions for hydrogen atom. Of all the elements, hydrogen atom has  the simplest line spectrum.

Although a single atom can be in only one excited state at a time, the collection of atoms contains all possible excited states. The light emitted as these atoms fall to lower energy states is responsible for the spectrum. (b) Atomic absorption. When white light is passed through unexcited atomic hydrogen and then through a slit and prism, the transmitted light is lacking in intensity at the same wavelengths as are emitted in (a) The recorded absorption spectrum is also a line spectrum and the photographic negative of the emission spectrum. table 2.3  the spectral lines for atomic  Hydrogen series n1n2spectral region Lyman BalmerPaschenBrackettPfund123452,3....3,4....4,5....5,6....6,7....UltravioletVisibleInfraredInfraredInfrared Unit 2.indd   45 9/9/2022   4:28:12 PM 2024-25 46 chemistry becomes more and more complex for heavier  atom.

            "hydrogen atom (The diagram shows the Lyman, Balmer and Paschen series of transitions)atomic structure and spectra. Bohr’s model  for hydrogen atom is based on the following  postulates: i) The electron in the hydrogen atom  can  move around the nucleus in a circular  path of fixed radius and energy. These  paths are called orbits, stationary states or allowed energy states. These orbits are arranged concentrically around the nucleus. ii)  The energy of an electron in the orbit does not change w ith time. However,  the electron will move from a lower stationary state to a higher stationary state when required amount of energy is absorbed by the electron or energy is emitted when electron moves from higher stationary state to lower stationary state (equation 2.16). The energy change does not take place in a continuous manner. angular momentum Just as linear momentum  is the product  of mass (m) and linear velocity (v), angular  momentum is the product of moment of inertia (I )  and angular velocity (ω). For an  electron of mass me, moving in a circular  path of radius r around the nucleus,    angular momentum = I × ω Since I  = mer2, and  ω = v/r where v is the  linear velocity,  ∴angular momentum =  mer2 × v/r = mevr iii) The frequency of radiation absorbed or  emitted w hen transition occurs between  two stationary states that differ in  energy by ∆E, is given by:                         (2.10)  Where E1 and E2 are the energies of the  lower and higher allowed energy states  respectively. This expression is commonly  known as Bohr’s frequency rule. iv) The angular momentum of an electron is quantised. In a given stationary state it can be expressed as in equation  (2.11)    mr nh ev/unif03d.2/unif070  n = 1,2,3.....        (2.11)--- --- \n",

Thus an electron can move only in those  orbits for which its angular momentum is  integral multiple of h /2π.  That means angular  momentum is quantised. Radiation is emitted or obsorbed only when transition of electron takes place from one quantised value of angular momentum to another. Therefore, Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory does not apply  here that is why only certain fixed orbits  are allowed. The details regarding the derivation of  energies of the station ary states used by Bohr,  are quite complicated and will be discussed in higher classes. However, according to Bohr’s theory for hydrogen atom:a)  The stationary states for electron are numbered n = 1,2,3.......... These integral  numbers (Section 2.6.2) are known as Principal quantum numbers . b)  The radii of  the stationary states are  expressed as:   rn  = n2 a0                                      (2.12)  where a0 = 52.9 pm. Thus the radius of  the first stationary  state, called the bohr  orbit, is 52.9 pm. Normally the electron in the hydrogen atom is found in this orbit (that is n =1). As n increases the  value of r will increase. In other words the electron will be present away from the nucleus. c)  The most important property associated with the electron, is the energy of its stationary state. It is  given by the  expression. EnnH/unif03d/unif02d/unif0e6 /unif0e8/unif0e7/unif0f6 /unif0f8/unif0f7 R1--- --- \n",

The energy of the  lowest state, also called as the ground state, is   E1 = –2.18× 10–18 (1 12) = –2.18× 10–18 J. The  energy of the stationary state for n = 2, will be : E2 = –2.18× 10–18J (1 22) = –0.545× 10–18 J. Fig. 2.11 depicts the energies of different  stationary states or energy levels of hydrogen atom. This representation is called an energy level diagram. When  the electron is free from the influence  of nucleus, the energy is taken as zero. The electron  in this situation is associated with the  stationary state of Principal Quantum number = n = ∞ and is called as ionized hydrogen atom.  When the electron is attracted by the nucleus  and is present in orbit n, the energy is emitted   and its energy is lowered. That is the reason  What does the negative electronic  energy (En) for hydrogen atom mean? The energy of the electron in a hydrogen  atom has a negative sign for all possible  orbits (eq. 2.13). What does this negative sign convey? This negative sign means that the energy of the electron in the atom is lower than the energy of a free electron at rest. A free electron at rest is  an electron that is infinitely far away  from the nucleus and is assigned the energy value of zero. Mathematically, this corresponds  to setting n equal to infinity  in the equation (2.13) so that E∞=0. As the  electron gets closer to the nucleus (as n decreases), E n becomes larger in absolute  value and more and more negative. The most negative energy value is given by n=1 which corresponds to the most stable  orbit. We call this the ground state.Niels Bohr--- --- \n",

Since many such wave functions are possible for an electron, there are many atomic orbitals in an atom. These “one electron orbital wave functions” or orbitals form the basis of the electronic structure of atoms. In each orbital, the electron has  a definite energy. An orbital cannot  contain more than two electrons. In  a  multi-electron atom, the electrons are filled  in various orbitals in the order of  increasing energy. For each electron of a multi-electron atom, there shall, therefore,  be an orbital wave function  characteristic of the orbital it occupies. All the information about the electron in an atom is stored in its orbital wave function  ψ and quantum mechanics  makes it possible to extract this information out of  ψ. 5.  The probability  of finding an electron at  a point within an atom is  proportional to  the square of the orbital wave function i.e., | ψ|2 at that point. | ψ|2 is known  as probability density and is always  positive. From the value of |ψ|2 at  different points within an atom, it is possible to predict the region around the nucleus where electron will most probably be found. 2.6.1  orbitals and Quantum numbers  A large number  of orbitals are possible in  an atom.

Each orbital is  designated by three  quantum numbers labelled as n, l and ml.  the principal quantum number ‘n’ is  a  positive integer with value of n = 1,2,3....... The principal quantum number determines  the size and to large extent the energy of the  orbital.

But all these quantum numbers are not enough to explain the line spectr a observed in the case of multi-electron  atoms, that is, some of the lines actually occur in doublets (two lines closely spaced), triplets (three lines, closely spaced) etc. This suggests the presence of a few more energy levels than predicted by the three quantum numbers. In 1925, George Uhlenbeck and Samuel  Goudsmit proposed the presence of the fourth  quantum number known as the electron spin quantum number (m s). An electron  spins around its own axis, much in a similar way as earth spins around its own axis while revolving around the sun. In other words, an electron has, besides charge and mass, intrinsic spin angular quantum number. Spin angular momentum of the electron — a vector  quantity, can have two orientations relative to the chosen axis. These two orientations are distinguished by the spin quantum numbers m s which can take the values of +½ or –½.  These are called the two spin states of the electron and are normally  represented by  two arrows, ↑ (spin up) and ↓ (spin down). Two  electrons that have different ms values (one +½  and the other –½) are said to have opposite--- --- \n",
            " --- --- spins. An orbital cannot hold more than two electrons and these two electrons should have opposite spins. To sum up, the four quantum numbers  provide the following information : i)  n defines the shell,  determines  the size  of the orbital and also to a large extent the energy of the orbital. ii)  There are n subshells in the nth shell. l  identifies the subshell and determines   the shape of the orbital  (see section  2.6.2). There are (2l+1) orbitals of each type in a subshell, that is, one s orbital (l = 0), three p orbitals (l  = 1) and five  d orbitals (l  = 2) per subshell. To some  extent l also determines the energy of  the orbital in a multi-electron atom. iii) ml designates the orientation of the  orbital. For a given value of l , ml has  (2l+1) values, the same as the number of orbitals per subshell. It means that  orbit, orbital and its importance Orbit and orbital are not synonymous. An orbit, as proposed by Bohr, is a circular path around the  nucleus in which an electron moves. A precise description of this path of the electron is impossible according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr orbits, therefore, have no real meaning and their existence can never be demonstrated experimentally. An atomic orbital, on the other hand, is a quantum mechanical concept and refers to the one electron wave function  ψ in an atom. It is  characterized by three quantum numbers (n, l and ml) and its value depends upon the coordinates  of the electron. ψ has, by itself, no physical meaning. It is the square of the wave function i.e., | ψ|2  which has a physical meaning. | ψ|2 at any point in an atom gives the value of probability density  at that point. Probability density (| ψ|2) is the probability per unit volume and the product of | ψ|2\n",

            "11\n",
            "and a small volume (called a volume element) yields the probability  of finding the electron in that  volume (the reason for specifying a small volume  element is that | ψ|2 varies from one region to  another in space but its value can be assumed to be constant within a small volume element). The  total probability  of finding the electron in a given volume can then be calculated  by the sum  of all the products of | ψ|2 and the corresponding volume elements. It is thus possible to get the  probable distribution of an electron in an orbital. Unit 2.indd   56 9/9/2022   4:28:17 PM 2024-25 57 structure of atom the number of orbitals is equal to the  number of ways in which they are oriented.  iv)  ms refers to orientation of the spin of the  electron. According to the German physicist,  Max Born, the square of the wave function   (i.e.,ψ 2) at a point gives the probability density  of the electron at that point. The variation of  ψ 2 as a function of r for 1s and 2s orbitals  is given in Fig. 2.12(b). Here again, you may note that the curves for 1s and 2s orbitals are different. It may be noted that for 1s  orbital the  probability density is maximum at the nucleus and it decreases sharply as we move away from it. On the other hand, for 2s orbital  the probability  density first decreases   sharply to zero and again starts increasing. After  reaching a small maxima it decreases  again and approaches zero as the value of r increases further. The region where this  probability density function reduces to zero  is called nodal surfaces or simply nodes.  In general, it has been found that ns-orbital has (n – 1) nodes, that is, number of nodes increases with increase of principal quantum number n. In other words, number of nodes--- --- \n",
            " --- --- for 2s orbital is one, two for 3 s and so on. These probability density variation can be  visualised in terms of charge cloud diagrams [Fig. 2.13(a)]. In these diagrams, the density Fig. 2.12  The plots of (a) the orbital wave   function ψ(r); (b) the variation of  probability density ψ2(r) as a function  of distance r of the electron from the nucleus for 1s and 2s orbitals. Problem 2.17  What is the total number of orbitals  associated with the principal quantum number n = 3 ? solution For n = 3, the  possible values of l are  0, 1 and 2. Thus there is one 3s orbital   (n = 3, l = 0 and ml = 0); there are three  3p orbitals (n = 3, l = 1 and ml = –1, 0,  +1); there are five 3d orbitals (n = 3,  l =  2 and ml = –2, –1, 0, +1+, +2). Therefore, the total number of orbitals is 1+3+5 = 9 The same value can also be obtained by  using the relation; number of orbitals   = n 2, i.e.  32 = 9. Problem 2.18  Using s, p, d, f notations, describe the  orbital with the following quantum  numbers  (a) n = 2, l = 1, (b) n = 4, l = 0, (c) n = 5,   l = 3, (d) n = 3, l = 2 solution   n   l orbital     a)  2  1   2p     b)  4  0   4s     c)  5  3   5f     d)  3  2   3d 2.6.2  shapes of atomic orbitals The orbital wave function or ψ for an electron  in an atom has no physical meaning. It--- --- \n",
            " --- --- is simply a mathematical function of the coordinates of the electron. However, for different orbitals the plots of corresponding wave functions as a function of r  (the distance  from the nucleus) are different. Fig. 2.12(a), gives such plots for 1s (n = 1, l = 0) and 2s   (n = 2, l = 0) orbitals.  Unit 2.indd   57 9/9/2022   4:28:17 PM 2024-25 58 chemistry of the dots in a region represents electron  probability density in that region. boundary surface diagrams of constant  probability  density for different orbitals give  a fairly good representation of the shapes of the orbitals. In this representation, a boundary surface or contour surface is drawn in space for an orbital on which the value of probability density | ψ|2 is constant.  In principle many such boundary surfaces may be possible. However, for a given orbital, only that boundary surface diagram of constant probability density* is taken to be good representation of the shape of the orbital which encloses a region or volume in which  the probability  of finding the electron  is very high, say, 90%. The boundary surface  diagram for 1s  and 2s orbitals are given in   Fig. 2.13(b). One may ask a question : Why do we not draw a boundary surface diagram, which bounds a region in which the probability of  finding the electron is, 100 %? The answer  to this question is that the probability density | ψ|2 has always some value, howsoever  small it may be, at any finite distance from  the nucleus. It is therefore, not  possible to  draw a boundary surface diagram of a rigid size  in which the probability  of finding the  electron is 100%. Boundary surface diagram for a  s orbital is actually a sphere centred on  the nucleus. In two dimensions, this sphere looks like a circle. It encloses a region in which  probability  of finding the electron is--- --- \n",
            " --- --- about 90%. Thus, we s ee that 1 s and 2s orbitals are  spherical in shape. In reality all the s-orbitals are spherically symmetric, that is, the probability  of finding the electron at a given  distance is equal in all the directions. It is also observed that the size of the s orbital increases with increase in  n, that is, 4s > 3s > 2s > 1s  and the electron is located further away from the nucleus as the principal quantum number increases. Boundary surface diagrams for three  2p orbitals (l = 1) are shown in Fig. 2.14. In these diagrams, the nucleus is at the origin. Here, unlike s-orbitals, the boundary surface diagrams are not spherical. Instead each   p orbital consists of two sections called lobes that are on either side of the plane that passes through the nucleus. The probability density  * If probability density |ψ|2 is constant on a given surface, |ψ| is also constant over the surface. The boundary surface  for |ψ|2 and |ψ| are identical.Fig. 2.14  Boundary surface diagrams of the three 2p orbitals.Fig. 2.13  (a) Probability density plots of 1s and  2s atomic orbitals.

The size, shape and energy of the three orbitals are identical. They differ however, in the way the lobes are oriented. Since the lobes may be considered to lie along the x, y or z axis, they are given the designations 2p x, 2py, and 2pz. It should be  understood, however, that there is no simple relation between the values of m l (–1, 0 and +1)\n",

            "and the x, y and z directions. For our purpose, it is sufficient  to remember  that, because  there are three possible values of ml, there  are, therefore, three p  orbitals whose axes  are mutually perpendicular. Like s orbitals, p orbitals increase in size and energy with increase in the principal quantum number and hence the order of the energy and size of various p orbitals is 4p  > 3p > 2p. Further, like  s orbitals, the probability density functions for p-orbital also pass through value zero, besides  at  zero and infinite distance, as the distance  from the nucleus increases. The number of nodes are given by the n –2, that is number  of radial node is 1 for 3p orbital,  two for 4p  orbital and so on. For l = 2, the orbital is known as d-orbital  and the minimum value of principal quantum number (n ) has to be 3. as the value of l  cannot  be greater than n–1.  There are five ml values  (–2, –1, 0, +1 and +2) for l = 2 and thus there are  five d orbitals. The boundary surface  diagram  of d orbitals are shown in Fig. 2.15. The five d-orbitals are designated as dxy,  dyz, dxz, dx2–y2 and dz2. The shapes of the first  four d-orbitals are similar to each other, where  as that of the fifth one, dz2, is different from  others, but all five 3d orbitals are equivalent  in energy. The d  orbitals for which n  is greater  than 3  (4d, 5d...) also have shapes similar to  3d orbital, but differ in energy and size. Besides the radial nodes (i.e., probability  density function is zero), the probability density functions for the np and nd orbitals are zero at the plane (s), passing through the nucleus (origin). For example, in case of p z--- --- \n",
            " --- --- z  orbital, xy-plane is a nodal plane, in case of d xy orbital, there are two nodal planes passing  through the origin and bisecting the xy plane containing z-axis. These are called angular nodes and number of angular nodes are given by ‘l’, i.e., one angular node for p orbitals, two  angular nodes for ‘d’ orbitals and so on.  the  total number of nodes are given by ( n–1),  i.e., sum of l angular nodes and (n – l – 1)  radial nodes. 2.6.3 energies of orbitals The energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom  is determi ned solely by the principal quantum Fig. 2.15  Boundary surface diagrams of the five  3d orbitals. Unit 2.indd   59 9/9/2022   4:28:20 PM 2024-25 60 chemistry number. Thus the energy of the orbitals in  hydrogen atom  increases as follows : 1s < 2s = 2p < 3s = 3p = 3d <4s = 4p = 4d  = 4f <                                               (2.23)   and is depicted in Fig. 2.16. Although the  shapes of 2s  and 2p  orbitals are different,   an electron has the same energy when it is in the 2s orbital as when it is present in 2p orbital. The orbitals having the same energy are called degenerate.  The 1s orbital in a  hydrogen atom, as said earlier, corresponds to the most stable condition and is called the ground state and an electron residing in this orbital is most strongly held by the nucleus. An electron in the 2s, 2p or higher orbitals in a hydrogen atom is in excited state.The energy of an electron in a multi-   electron atom, unlike that of the hydrogen--- --- \n",
            " --- --- atom  and (b) multi-electronic atoms. Note that orbitals for the same value of principal quantum number, have the same energies even for different azimuthal quantum number for hydrogen atom. In case of multi-electron atoms, orbitals with same principal quantum number possess different energies for different azimuthal quantum numbers. Unit 2.indd   60 9/9/2022   4:28:20 PM 2024-25 61 structure of atom (that is orbital energy) decreases (that is   more negative) with the increase of atomic  number (Z ). Both the attractive and repulsive  interactions depend upon the shell and shape  of the orbital in which the electron is present. For example electrons present in spherical shaped, s orbital shields the outer electrons  from the nucleus more effectively as compared to electrons present in p  orbital. Similarly  electrons present in p  orbitals shield the outer  electrons from the nucleus more than the electrons present in d  orbitals, even though all   these orbitals are present in the same shell. Further within a shell, due to spherical shape of s orbital, the s  orbital electron spends more  time close to the nucleus in comparison to p orbital electron which spends more time in the vicinity of nucleus in comparison to d orbital electron. In other words, for a given  shell (principal quantum number), the Z eff  experienced by the electron decreases with  increase of azimuthal quantum number (l), that is, the s orbital electron will be more tightly bound to the nucleus than p orbital electron which in turn will be better tightly bound than the d orbital electron. The energy of electrons in s orbital will be lower (more negative) than that of p orbital electron  which will have less energy than that of d orbital electron and so on. Since the extent of shielding from the nucleus is different for electrons in different orbitals, it leads to the splitting of energy levels within the same shell (or same principal quantum number), that is, energy of electron in an orbital, as mentioned earlier, depends upon the values of n and l. Mathematically, the dependence\n",
            "p orbitals increase in size and energy with increase in the principal quantum number . The order of the energy and size of various orbitals is 4p > 3p > 2p . Further, like s orbitals, the probability density functions for p-orbital also pass through value zero, besides at zero and infinite distance, as the distance from the nucleus increases. The number of nodes are given by the n –2, that is number of radial nodes is 1 for 3p orbital\n",
            "13\n",
            "of energies of the orbitals on n and l are quite complicated but one simple rule is that, the lower the value of (n + l) for an orbital, the lower is its energy.  if two orbitals have  the same value of (n + l ), the orbital with  lower value of n  will have the lower energy.   The Table 2.5 illustrates the (n + l ) rule and  Fig. 2.16 depicts the energy levels of multi-electrons atoms. It may be noted that different subshells of a particular shell have different energies in case of multi-electrons atoms. However, in hydrogen atom, these have the same energy. Lastly it may be mentioned here that energies of the orbitals in the same  subshell decrease with increase in the atomic number (Z eff). For example, energy of  2s orbital of hydrogen atom is greater than that of 2s  orbital of lithium and that of lithium  is greater than that of sodium and so on, that  is, E 2s(H) > E2s(Li) > E2s(Na) > E2s(K). 2.6.4 filling of orbitals in atom The filling of electrons  into the orbitals of  different atoms takes place according to the aufbau principle which is  based on the  Pauli’s exclusion principle, the Hund’s rule of maximum multiplicity and the relative energies of the orbitals. Aufbau Principle The word ‘aufbau’ in German means ‘building  up’. The building up of orbitals means the table 2.5  arrangement of orbitals with  increasing energy on the basis  of (n+l ) rule Unit 2.indd   61 9/9/2022   4:28:20 PM 2024-25 62 chemistry filling up of orbitals with electrons. The  principle states : in the ground state of the  atoms, the orbitals are  filled in order of  their increasing energies. In other words, electrons  first occupy the lowest energy orbital--- --- \n",
            " --- --- available to them and enter into higher energy orbitals only after the lower  energy orbitals  are filled. As you have learnt above, energy  of a given orbi tal depends upon effective  nuclear charge and different type of orbitals are affected to different extent. Thus, there is no single ordering of energies of orbitals which will be universally correct for all atoms. However, following order of  energies of  the orbitals is extremely useful: 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s... The order may be remembered by using  the method given in Fig. 2.17. Starting from the top, the direction of the arrows gives the  order  of filling of orbitals, that is starting  from right top to bottom left. With respect to placement of outermost valence electrons, it is remarkably accurate for  all atoms. For  example, valence  electron in potassium  must choose between 3d and 4s orbitals and  as predicted by this sequence, it is found in 4s  orbital. The above order should be  assumed  to be a rough guide to the filling  of energy levels. In many cases, the orbitals are similar  in energy and small changes in  atomic structure may bring about a change in  the order of filling. Even then, the above  series is a useful guide to the building of the electronic structure of an atom provided that it is remembered that exceptions may occur. Pauli Exclusion Principle The  number of electrons to be filled in various  orbitals is restricted by the exclusion  principle,  given by the Austrian scientist Wolfgang Pauli  (1926). According to this principle : no two  electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quan tum numbers. Pauli exclusion  principle can also be stated as : “ only two--- --- \n",
            " --- --- electrons may exist in the same orbital and these electrons must have opposite spin.” This means that  the two electrons can have  the same value of three quantum numbers n, l and m l, but must have the opposite spin  quantum number. The restriction imposed by Pauli’s exclusion principle on the number of electrons in an orbital helps in calculating the capacity of electrons to be present in any subshell. For example, subshell 1s  comprises  one orbital and thus the maximum number of electrons present in 1s  subshell can be two, in  p and d subshells, the maximum number of electrons can be 6 and 10 and so on. This can be summed up as : the maximum number of electrons in the shell with principal quantum number n is equal to 2n 2. Hund’s Rule of Maximum Multiplicity This rule deals with the filling of electrons into  the orbitals belonging to the same subshell  (that is, orbitals of equal energy, called degenerate orbitals). It states : pairing of Fig.2.17  Order of filling of orbitals Unit 2.indd   62 9/9/2022   4:28:20 PM 2024-25 63 structure of atom electrons in the orbitals belonging to the  same subshell (p , d or f ) does not take  place until each orbital belonging to that subshell has got one electron each i.e., it is singly occupied. Since there are three p,  five d and seven f  orbitals, therefore, the pairing of electrons will start in the p , d and f orbitals with the entry  of 4th, 6th and 8th electron, respectively. It has  been observed that half filled and fully  filled degenerate  set of orbitals acquire extra  stability due to their symmetry (see Section, 2.6.7). 2.6.5  Electronic Configuration of Atoms The distribution of electrons  into orbitals of an  atom is called its electronic configuration.  If one keeps in mind the basic rules which govern--- --- \n",
            " --- --- the filling of different atomic orbitals,  the electronic configurations of different atoms can be written very easily. The  electronic  configuration  of different  atoms can be represented in two ways. For   example : (i)   sa  pbdc ...... notation (ii)  Orbital diagram  s                     p                        d In the first notation, the su bshell is  represented by the respective letter symbol  and the number of electrons present in the subshell is depicted, as the super script, like  a, b, c, ... etc. The similar subshell represented  for different shells is differentiated by writing the principal quantum number before the respective subshell. In the second notation  each orbital of the subshell is represented by a box and the electron is represented by an arrow (↑) a positive spin or an arrow (↓)  a negative spin. The advantage of second notation  over the first is that it represents  all  the four quantum numbers. The hydrogen atom has only one electron  which goes i n the orbital with the lowest energy,  namely 1s . The electronic  configuration  of the  hydrogen atom is 1 s1 meaning that it has  one electron in the 1s  orbital. The second  electron in helium (He) can also occupy the 1s orbital. Its configuration  is, therefore,  1s2.  As mentioned above, the two electrons differ from each other with opposite spin, as can be  seen from the orbital diagram. The third electron of lithium (Li) is not  allowed in the 1 s orbital because of Pauli  exclusion principle. It, therefore, takes the next available choice, namely the 2s orbital. The  electronic  configuration  of Li is 1s22s1.  The 2s orbital can accommodate one more electron.--- --- \n",
            " --- --- The configuration  of beryllium  (Be)  atom is, therefore, 1s2 2s2 (see Table 2.6,  page 66 for the electronic  configurations  of  elements). In the next six elements—boron   (B, 1s22s22p1), carbon (C, 1s22s22p2), nitrogen  (N, 1s22s22p3), oxygen (O, 1s22s22p4), fluorine  (F, 1s22s22p5) and neon (Ne, 1s22s22p6), the 2p  orbitals get progressively  filled. This process  is completed with the neon atom. The orbital  picture of  these elements can be represented  as follows : The electronic configuration of the  elements sodium (Na,1s22s22p63s1) to argon   (Ar,1s22s22p63s23p6), follow exactly the same  pattern as the elements from lithium to neon with the difference that the 3s  and 3p  orbitals  are  getting filled now. This process can be  simplified  if we represent  the total number  of  electrons in the first two shells by the  name of element neon  (Ne). The electronic  configuration  of the elements from sodium to  Unit 2.indd   63 9/9/2022   4:28:21 PM 2024-25 64 chemistry argon can be written as (Na, [Ne]3s1) to (Ar,  [Ne] 3s23p6). The electrons in the completely  filled shells are known as core electrons and  the electrons that are added to the electronic  shell with the highest principal quantum number are called valence electrons.  For--- --- \n",
            " --- --- For  example, the electrons in Ne are the core electrons and the electrons from Na to Ar are the valence electrons. In potassium (K) and calcium (Ca), the 4s orbital, being lower in energy than the 3d orbitals, is occupied by one and two electrons respectively. A new pattern is followed beginning with  scandium (Sc). The 3d  orbital, being lower  in energy than the 4p  orbital, is filled first.  Consequently, in the next ten elements,  scandium (Sc), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium  (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe),  cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn),  the five 3d orbitals are progressively  occupied. We  may be puzzled by the fact  that chromium  and copper have five and ten  electrons in 3d orbitals  rather than four and  nine as their position would have indicated with two-electrons in the 4s orbital. The reason  is that fully filled orbitals and half- filled orbitals have extra stability (that is,  lower energy). Thus p3, p6, d5, d10,f 7, f14 etc.  configurations,  which are either half-filled   or fully filled, are more stable. Chromium   and copper therefore adopt the d5 and  d10 configuration (Section 2.6.7)[caution:  exceptions do exist]  With the saturation of the 3d  orbitals,  the filling of the 4p orbital starts at gallium  (Ga) and is complete at  krypton (Kr). In the  next eighteen elements from rubidium (Rb)  to xenon (Xe), the pattern of filling the 5s,  4d and 5 p orbitals are similar to that of 4s,--- --- \n",
            " --- --- 3d and 4p orbitals as discussed above. Then comes the turn of the 6s orbital. In caesium (Cs) and the barium (Ba), this orbital contains one and two electrons, respectively. Then from lanthanum  (La) to mercury (Hg), the filling up  of electrons takes place in 4 f and 5d orbitals. After this, filling of 6p, then 7s  and finally 5f  and 6d  orbitals takes place. The elements  after uranium (U)  are all short-lived and all of  them are produced  artificially.  The electronic   configurations  of the known elements  (as  determined by spectroscopic methods) are  tabulated in Table 2.6 (page 66). One may ask  what is the utility of knowing  the electron configuration? The modern approach to the chemistry, infact, depends almost entirely on electronic distribution to understand and explain chemical behaviour. For example, questions like why two or more atoms combine to form molecules, why some elements are metals while others are non-metals, why elements like helium and argon are not reactive but elements like the halogens are  reactive, find simple explanation  from the  electronic  configuration.  These questions  have  no answer in the Daltonian  model of atom.  A detailed understanding of the electronic structure of atom is, therefore,  very essential  for getting an insight into the various aspects of modern chemical knowledge. 2.6.6  stability of completely filled and    Half filled subshells The ground state electronic  configuration  of  the atom of an element always corresponds to  the state of the lowest total electronic  energy.  The electronic  configurations  of most of the  atoms follow the basic rules given in Section--- --- \n",
            " --- --- 2.6.5. However, in certain elements such as Cu, or Cr, where the two subshells (4s and 3d) differ slightly in their energies, an electron  shifts from a subshell of lower energy (4s ) to a  subshell of higher energy (3d), provided such a shift results in all orbitals of the subshell of higher energy getting either completely filled  or half filled. The valence electronic   configurations  of Cr and Cu, therefore,  are  3d5 4s1 and 3d10 4s1 respectively and not 3d4  4s2 and 3d9 4s2. It has been found that there is  extra stability associated with these electronic configurations. Unit 2.indd   64 9/9/2022   4:28:21 PM 2024-25 65 structure of atom The completely filled and completely   half-filled  subshells  are stable due to the  following reasons: 1.Symmetrical distribution of electrons: It  is well known that symmetry  leads to stability. The completely  filled  or half filled subshells  have symmetrical   distribution of electrons in them and are therefore more stable. Electrons in the same subshell (here 3d) have equal energy but different  spatial distribution.  Consequently, their shielding of one-another is relatively small and the electrons are more strongly attracted by the nucleus.2. Exchange Energy : The stabilizing effect arises whenever two or more electrons with the same spin are present in the degenerate orbitals of a subshell. These electrons tend to exchange their positions and the energy released due to this exchange is called exchange energy. The number of exchanges that can take place is maximum when the subshell is  either half filled or completely  filled   (Fig. 2.18). As a result th e exchange  energy is maximum and so is the stability.  You may note that the exchange--- --- \n",
            " --- --- You may note that the exchange  energy is at the basis of Hund’s rule that electrons which enter orbitals of equal energy have parallel spins as far as possible. In other words, the extra stability  of half-filled  and completely  filled  subshell is   due to: (i) relatively small  shielding, (ii) smaller coulombic repulsion energy, and (iii) larger exchange energy. Details  about the exchange  energy will be  dealt with in higher classes.Fig. 2.18  Possible exchange for a d5  configurationCauses of Stability of Completely Filled and Half-filled Subshells Unit 2.indd   65 9/9/2022   4:28:21 PM 2024-25 66 chemistry Table 2.6  Electronic Configurations of the Elements * Elements with exceptional electronic configurations Unit 2.indd   66 9/9/2022   4:28:22 PM 2024-25 67 structure of atom ** Elements with atomic number 112 and above have been reported but not yet fully authenticated and named.

The first atomic theory, proposed by John Dalton in 1808, regarded atom as  the ultimate indivisible particle of matter. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, it was  proved experimentally that atoms are divisible and consist of three fundamental particles: electrons, protons and  neutrons . The discovery of sub-atomic particles led to the proposal  of various atomic models to explain the structure of atom. Thomson in 1898 proposed that an atom consists of uniform sphere of positive electricity\n",
